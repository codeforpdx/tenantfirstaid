        </h3>
        <p>
          The Services and Tenant First Aid Content provided through the
          Services are not legal advice. Legal information is not the same as
          legal advice, which is the application of law to an individual’s
          specific circumstances. The Tenant First Aid Services are not a
          substitute for and do not replace the advice or representation of a
          licensed attorney. Although Tenant First Aid goes to great lengths to
          make sure the Tenant First Aid Content is accurate and up to date, we
          make no claim as to the accuracy of the Tenant First Aid Content and
          are not responsible for any consequences that may result from the use
          of the Services. We recommend that you consult with a licensed

          and your interpretation of it are appropriate for your particular
          situation. You should not and are not authorized to rely on the
          Services or Tenant First Aid Content as a source of legal advice. The
          use of the Services does not create an attorney-client relationship
          between you or any user and Qiu Qiu Law or any of its providers,
          partners or affiliated organizations.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold my-4">8. Indemnification</h3>

          defend, and hold harmless Tenant First Aid, Qiu Qiu Law, Code PDX, and
          its respective partners and affiliated organizations and each of our
          and their respective officers, directors, agents, partners and
          employees (individually and collectively, the "

          misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including
          intellectual property rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct
          in connection with our Services. You agree to promptly notify us of
          any third party Claims, cooperate with the Tenant First Aid Parties in
          defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated
          with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to, attorneys’
          fees). You also agree that the Tenant First Aid Parties will have
          control of the defense or settlement of any third party Claims. This
          indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities
          set forth in a written agreement between you and Tenant First Aid or
          the other Tenant First Aid Parties.

          Tenant First Aid and the other Tenant First Aid Parties will not be

          tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any
          indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive or special
          damages or lost profits, even if Tenant First Aid or the other Tenant

          other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under
          applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the
          exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the
          above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

          liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential)
          of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not

        <p>
          Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
          arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Tenant First Aid and limits
          the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          Except for small claims disputes in which you or Tenant First Aid seek
          to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the
          county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Tenant
          First Aid seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged
          unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Tenant First Aid waive
          your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or
          related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, all
          disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services
          will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in
          Multnomah County, Oregon in accordance with the Streamlined
          Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("
          <span className="underline">Rules</span>") of the Judicial Arbitration
          and Mediation Services ("<span className="underline">JAMS</span>"),
          which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by
          reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and
          understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the
          rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or
          should not apply for any reason.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          You and Tenant First Aid agree that any dispute arising out of or
          related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Tenant
          First Aid and that any dispute will be resolved solely through
          individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration,
          class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          You and Tenant First Aid agree that these Terms affect interstate
          commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 14 will be
          substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration
          Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "
          <span className="underline">FAA</span>"), to the maximum extent
          permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and
          the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make
          all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to
          grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided,
          however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a
          class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by
          these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration
          and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside
          over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over
          any proceeding involving more than one individual. You agree that for
          any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and we will
          pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated
          by us, we will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Tenant First Aid
          agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Illinois and
          the United States sitting in Multnomah County, Oregon have exclusive
          jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration
          award.
