### Prerequisites
 - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
 - [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

1. copy `backend/.env.example` to a new file named `.env` in the same directory and populate it with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can set an invalid key, in which case the bot will return error messages. This may still be useful for developing other features.
1. `cd backend`
1. `docker-compose up` (use `-d` if you want to run this in the background, otherwise open a new terminal)
1. `uv sync`
1. If you have not uploaded the Oregon Housing Law documents to a vector store in OpenAI, run `uv run scripts/create_vector_store.py` and follow the instructions to add the vector store ID to your `.env`.
1. `uv run python -m tenantfirstaid.app`
1. Open a new terminal / tab
1. `cd ../frontend`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
1. Start chatting

### Backend Development & Checks

1. change to the `backend/` directory
   ```sh
   % cd backend
   ```
  - run individual checks
    1. *format* Python code with `ruff`
       ```sh
       % uv run ruff format
       ```
       or
       ```sh
       % make fmt
       ```
    1. *lint* Python code with `ruff`
       ```sh
       % uv run ruff check
       ```
       or
       ```sh
       % make lint
       ```
    1. *typecheck* Python code with `ty`
       ```sh
       % uv run ty check
       ```
       or
       ```sh
       % make typecheck
       ```

       *typecheck* with other Python typecheckers which are not protected in [PR Checks](.github/workflows/pr-check.yml) - useful for completeness & a 2nd opinion
       1. *typecheck* Python code with `mypy`
          ```sh
          % uv run mypy -p tenantfirstaid --python-executable .venv/bin/python3 --check-untyped-defs
          ```
          or
          ```sh
          % make typecheck-mypy
          ```
       1. *typecheck* Python code with `pyrefly`
          ```sh
          % uv run pyrefly check --python-interpreter .venv/bin/python3
          ```
          or
          ```sh
          % make typecheck-pyrefly
          ```
    1. *test* Python code with `pytest`
       ```sh
       % uv run pytest
       ```
       or
       ```sh
       % make test
       ```
  - or run the above checks in one-shot
    ```sh
    % make --keep-going check
    ```
    `--keep-going` will continue to run checks, even if previous `make` rule fail.  Omit if you want to stop after the first `make` rule fails.

## Contributing

## Remote server setup
On DO, we:
1. added our ssh public keys
2. install nginx
3. Kent got the tls cert (just ask chatgpt?)
