"You: I just moved into a new apartment and it is so hot in the summer
Bot: Has your landlord told you that you can’t install a portable air-conditioning (or other cooling) unit, or placed any restrictions on it?
You: no, but shouldn't the apartment have ac?
Bot: Oregon only obligates landlords to supply built-in cooling if the building permits for your unit were issued on or after April 1, 2024 (ORS 90.320 (1)(m)). Otherwise, you’re entitled to bring in a portable A/C (or similar device) and, with narrow safety-related exceptions, the landlord can’t stop you (ORS 90.355). 

Do you know roughly when the building was constructed or last permitted?
You: its brand new, so they started accepting tenants in feb of 2025
Bot: Do you know when the city issued the building’s certificate of occupancy (or final building permits)?
You: no, how would I know that? why does that matter?
Bot: It matters because ORS 90.320 (1)(m) now says: if the building permits for a dwelling were issued on or after April 1, 2024, the landlord must supply “adequate cooling facilities … maintained in good working order.” If the permits are older, built-in A/C is optional and your right is mainly to use a portable unit under ORS 90.355.

Two quick ways to learn the permit date:
1. Ask the manager or owner (they have the paperwork). 
2. Look it up online or call the city/county building department and request the “certificate of occupancy” date for your address (it’s public record).

If the permits are post-4/1/24 and the landlord hasn’t provided working cooling, you can give written notice demanding they fix the problem; if they don’t, you can use the habitability remedies in ORS 90.360 and 90.365.

Would you be willing to email the manager today and simply ask what date the final certificate of occupancy was issued?
You: how can I find out without contacting my landlord?
Bot: You can usually pull the permit history yourself (it’s public): most Oregon cities/counties have an online “building permits” or e-permitting search—type in the street address and the system shows the issue dates for permits and the certificate of occupancy. If there’s no web portal, you can phone or email the city/county building department and ask for the “final building permit / C of O date” for the address. 

Which city (or county) is your apartment in?
You: Oregon City in clackamas county
Bot: Use Oregon City’s public permit site (Search: “Oregon City eTRAKiT permits”) ? enter your address ? look for the “Certificate of Occupancy” or final building-permit issue date. 
Or phone the Oregon City Building Division (503-722-3789) and ask for the final permit date for your address.

Would you like the direct web link?
You: yes please
Bot: Here’s the portal: https://etrakit.orcity.org/etrakit/ (Use “Permit Search,” enter your street address and look for the “Certificate of Occupancy” or “Final” permit date.)",I just moved into a new apartment and it is so hot in the summer,"[""Tenant recently moved into a new apartment."", ""Tenant finds the apartment very hot during summer."", ""Tenant’s landlord has not restricted the installation of a portable air-conditioning unit."", ""The apartment building is brand new and began accepting tenants in February 2025."", ""Tenant does not know the date the city issued the building’s certificate of occupancy or final permits."", ""Tenant wants to learn the permit date without contacting the landlord."", ""Tenant’s apartment is located in Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon.""]","BOT: Sorry the place is so uncomfortable. To see what legal remedies you might have, can you tell me whether your lease says the landlord must provide air-conditioning or maintain the unit below a certain temperature? (ORS 90.320(1) lists what habitability standards a landlord must meet.)
USER: I just checked my lease, and it doesn't say anything about the landlord providing air-conditioning or keeping the apartment below a certain temperature.
BOT: Under Oregon law a landlord has to keep the unit “safe, sanitary and in good repair,” but air-conditioning is not listed as required habitability equipment. ORS 90.320(1). Unless your lease promises A/C or the heat level is so extreme that the place is unsafe (e.g., creating a health hazard), the landlord generally has no duty to install or run A/C.

What you can do:
1. Put your concern in writing and ask the landlord to approve a tenant-supplied window unit or other cooling device.
2. If you believe the temperature makes the unit unsafe, give written notice describing the condition and asking for correction within a reasonable time (usually 30 days). If they don’t act, ORS 90.360(1) lets you terminate the rental or, for smaller fixes, repair and deduct.

If you’re in Portland, you may also request a free cooling device grant under Portland City Code 30.01.
USER: Thanks for the information! My landlord hasn’t restricted the installation of a portable A/C unit, so I might go ahead and get one. But I’m wondering if there are any building rules that might limit things like that. How can I identify when this new building received its final permits or certificate of occupancy? I think knowing that might help me learn more about the building's rules.
BOT: To pull the permit or certificate-of-occupancy file you’ll need to search the local building department’s database, and the exact site depends on where the property sits.  
Which city (or county if you’re outside a city) is the building located in?  (Under ORS 90.320(1)(a) the landlord must comply with “applicable building codes,” so the permit record will show what rules apply.)
USER: The apartment building is located in Oregon City, which is in Clackamas County, Oregon.
BOT: Try Oregon City’s public permit portal first:

1. Go to eTRAKiT: https://etrakit.orcity.org  
2. In the “Search” box choose “Permits,” enter the street number and name, and hit “Search.”  
3. Look for a record type labeled “CO” (Certificate of Occupancy) or “BLD-Final.” The issue date on that line is the final approval date.  

If nothing comes up, call Oregon City Building Division (503-722-3789, option 6) and ask staff to email you the certificate-of-occupancy or final inspection card; they can also search by tax lot if the address has changed.

Why it matters: Under ORS 90.320(1)(a) a landlord must keep the unit in compliance with the building code that was in force when that final approval issued, so the permit file shows what standards apply.  

Let me know if you need help reading the permit record.
USER: Thank you for the detailed instructions! I’ll check out the eTRAKiT system and see what I can find about the permits or certificate of occupancy. If I get confused or need help understanding the records, I’ll reach out again. Thanks for your help so far!
BOT: You’re welcome—happy to help. Would you like a quick guide to the key fields you’ll see in an Oregon City permit record (issue date, inspection status, code edition, etc.) so you can tell whether the unit meets ORS 90.320(1)(a) habitability standards?
USER: That sounds like it would be really helpful! Please share the guide so I’ll know what to look for when I check the permit records.
