A landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service charge billed to the tenant if:\n\n      (A) The utility or service charge to which the additional amount is added is for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;\n\n      (B) The additional amount is not more than 10 percent of the utility or service charge billed to the tenant;\n\n      (C) The total of the utility or service charge and the additional amount is less than the typical periodic cost the tenant would incur if the tenant contracted directly with the provider for the cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;\n\n      (D) The written rental agreement providing for the utility or service charge describes the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge; and\n\n      (E) Any billing or notice from the landlord regarding the utility or service charge lists the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or service charge.\n\n      (d)(A) A landlord must provide 60 days’ written notice to a tenant before the landlord may amend an existing rental agreement for a month-to-month tenancy to require a tenant to pay a public service charge that was adopted by a utility or service provider or a local government within the previous six months.\n\n      (B) A landlord may not hold a tenant liable for a public service charge billed to a previous tenant.\n\n      (C) A landlord may not require a tenant to agree to the amendment of an existing rental agreement, and may not terminate a tenant for refusing to agree to the amendment of a rental agreement, if the amendment would obligate the tenant to pay an additional amount for cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for Internet access or usage as provided under paragraph (c) of this subsection.\n\n      (e) A utility or service charge, including any additional amount added pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subsection, is not rent or a fee. Nonpayment of a utility or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394 but is grounds for termination of a rental agreement for cause under ORS 90.392.\n\n      (f) If a landlord fails to comply with paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this subsection, the tenant may recover from the landlord an amount equal to one month’s periodic rent or twice the amount wrongfully charged to the tenant, whichever is greater.\n\n      (5)(a) If a tenant, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or service and is unable to obtain the service prior to moving into the premises due to a nonpayment of an outstanding amount due by a previous tenant or the owner, the tenant may either:\n\n      (A) Pay the outstanding amount and deduct the amount from the rent;\n\n      (B) Enter into a mutual agreement with the landlord to resolve the lack of service; or\n\n      (C) Immediately terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice and the reason for the termination.\n\n      (b) If the tenancy terminates, the landlord shall return all moneys paid by the tenant as deposits, rent or fees within four days after termination.\n\n      (6) If a tenant, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or service and is unable to obtain the service after moving into the premises due to a nonpayment of an outstanding amount due by a previous tenant or the owner, the tenant may either:\n\n      (a) Pay the outstanding amount and deduct the amount from the rent; or\n\n      (b) Terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice 72 hours prior to the date of termination and the reason for the termination. The tenancy does not terminate if the landlord restores service or the availability of service during the 72 hours. If the tenancy terminates, the tenant may recover actual damages from the landlord resulting from the shutoff and the landlord shall return:\n\n      (A) Within four days after termination, all rent and fees; and\n\n      (B) All of the security deposit owed to the tenant under ORS 90.300.\n\n      (7) If a landlord, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or service and the utility or service is shut off due to a nonpayment of an outstanding amount, the tenant may either:\n\n      (a) Pay the outstanding balance and deduct the amount from the rent; or\n\n      (b) Terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice 72 hours prior to the date of termination and the reason for the termination. The tenancy does not terminate if the landlord restores service during the 72 hours. If the tenancy terminates, the tenant may recover actual damages from the landlord resulting from the shutoff and the landlord shall return:\n\n      (A) Within four days after termination, all rent prepaid for the month in which the termination occurs prorated from the date of termination or the date the tenant vacates the premises, whichever is later, and any other prepaid rent; and\n\n      (B) All of the security deposit owed to the tenant under ORS 90.300.\n\n      (8) If a landlord fails to return to the tenant the moneys owed as provided in subsection (5), (6) or (7) of this section, the tenant shall be entitled to twice the amount wrongfully withheld.\n\n      (9) This section does not preclude the tenant from pursuing any other remedies under this chapter.

(1) A landlord or, to the extent provided in this section, a landlord’s agent may enter into the tenant’s dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under the tenant’s exclusive control in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services, perform agreed yard maintenance or grounds keeping or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workers or contractors. The right of access of the landlord or landlord’s agent is limited as follows:\n\n      (a) A landlord or landlord’s agent may enter upon the premises under the tenant’s exclusive control not including the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant and without notice to the tenant, for the purpose of serving notices required or permitted under this chapter, the rental agreement or any provision of applicable law.\n\n      (b) In case of an emergency, a landlord may enter the dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant’s exclusive control without consent of the tenant, without notice to the tenant and at any time. “Emergency” includes but is not limited to a repair problem that, unless remedied immediately, is likely to cause serious damage to the premises. If a landlord makes an emergency entry in the tenant’s absence, the landlord shall give the tenant actual notice within 24 hours after the entry, and the notice shall include the fact of the entry, the date and time of the entry, the nature of the emergency and the names of the persons who entered.\n\n      (c) If the tenant requests repairs or maintenance in writing, the landlord or landlord’s agent, without further notice, may enter upon demand, in the tenant’s absence or without the tenant’s consent, for the purpose of making the requested repairs until the repairs are completed. The tenant’s written request may specify allowable times. Otherwise, the entry must be at a reasonable time. The authorization to enter provided by the tenant’s written request expires after seven days, unless the repairs are in progress and the landlord or landlord’s agent is making a reasonable effort to complete the repairs in a timely manner. If the person entering to do the repairs is not the landlord, upon request of the tenant, the person must show the tenant written evidence from the landlord authorizing that person to act for the landlord in making the repairs.\n\n      (d) A landlord and tenant may agree that the landlord or the landlord’s agent may enter the dwelling unit and the premises without notice at reasonable times for the purpose of showing the premises to a prospective buyer, provided that the agreement:\n\n      (A) Is executed at a time when the landlord is actively engaged in attempts to sell the premises;\n\n      (B) Is reflected in a writing separate from the rental agreement and signed by both parties; and\n\n      (C) Is supported by separate consideration recited in the agreement.\n\n      (e)(A) If a written agreement requires the landlord to perform yard maintenance or grounds keeping for the premises:\n\n      (i) A landlord and tenant may agree that the landlord or landlord’s agent may enter for that purpose upon the premises under the tenant’s exclusive control not including the dwelling unit, without notice to the tenant, at reasonable times and with reasonable frequency. The terms of the right of entry must be described in the rental agreement or in a separate written agreement.\n\n      (ii) A tenant may deny consent for a landlord or landlord’s agent to enter upon the premises pursuant to this paragraph if the entry is at an unreasonable time or with unreasonable frequency.

The landlord or landlord’s agent may not enter if the tenant, after receiving the landlord’s notice, denies consent to enter. The tenant must assert this denial of consent by giving actual notice of the denial to the landlord or the landlord’s agent or by attaching a written notice of the denial in a secure manner to the main entrance to that portion of the premises or dwelling unit of which the tenant has exclusive control, prior to or at the time of the attempt by the landlord or landlord’s agent to enter.\n\n      (2) A landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. A tenant may not unreasonably withhold consent from the landlord to enter.\n\n      (3) This section does not apply to tenancies consisting of a rental of space in a facility for a manufactured dwelling or floating home under ORS 90.505 to 90.850.\n\n      (4) If a tenancy consists of rented space for a manufactured dwelling or floating home that is owned by the tenant, but the tenancy is not subject to ORS 90.505 to 90.850 because the space is not in a facility, this section shall allow access only to the rented space and not to the dwelling or home.\n\n      (5) A landlord has no other right of access except:\n\n      (a) Pursuant to court order;\n\n      (b) As permitted by ORS 90.410 (2); or\n\n      (c) When the tenant has abandoned or relinquished the premises.\n\n      (6) If a landlord is required by a governmental agency to enter a dwelling unit or any portion of the premises under a tenant’s exclusive control, but the landlord fails to gain entry after a good faith effort in compliance with this section, the landlord may not be found in violation of any state statute or local ordinance due to the failure.\n\n      (7) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access or may terminate the rental agreement under ORS 90.392 and take possession as provided in ORS 105.100 to 105.168. In addition, the landlord may recover actual damages.\n\n      (8) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but that have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the reoccurrence of the conduct or may terminate the rental agreement pursuant to ORS 90.360 (1).

(1) As used in this section, “posted” means that a governmental agency has attached a copy of the agency’s written determination in a secure manner to the main entrance of the dwelling unit or to the premises or building of which the dwelling unit is a part.\n\n      (2)(a) If a governmental agency has posted a dwelling unit as unsafe and unlawful to occupy due to the existence of conditions that violate state or local law and materially affect health or safety to an extent that, in the agency’s determination, the tenant must vacate the unit and another person may not take possession of the unit, a landlord may not continue a tenancy or enter into a new tenancy for the dwelling unit until the landlord corrects the conditions that led to the agency’s determination.\n\n      (b) If a landlord knowingly violates paragraph (a) of this subsection, the tenant may immediately terminate the tenancy by giving the landlord actual notice of the termination and the reason for the termination and may recover from the landlord either two months’ periodic rent or up to twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant as a result of the violation, whichever is greater. The tenant need not terminate the tenancy to recover damages under this section.\n\n      (3)(a) If a governmental agency has given a written notice to a landlord that a dwelling unit has been determined to be unlawful, but not unsafe, to occupy due to the existence of conditions that violate state or local law and materially affect health or safety to an extent that, in the agency’s determination, although the unit is safe for an existing tenant to occupy, another person may not take possession of the unit, the landlord may not enter into a new tenancy for the dwelling unit until the landlord corrects the conditions that led to the agency’s determination.\n\n      (b) If a landlord knowingly violates paragraph (a) of this subsection, the tenant may recover from the landlord either two months’ periodic rent or up to twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant as a result of the violation, whichever is greater.\n\n      (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, a landlord is not liable to a tenant for a violation of paragraph (a) of this subsection if, prior to the commencement of the tenancy, the landlord discloses to the tenant that the dwelling unit has been determined to be unlawful to occupy.\n\n      (d) A disclosure described in paragraph (c) of this subsection must be in writing, include a description of the conditions that led to the agency’s determination and state that the landlord is obligated to correct the conditions before entering into a new tenancy. The landlord shall attach a copy of the agency’s notice to the disclosure. The notice copy may provide the information required by this paragraph to be disclosed by the landlord to the tenant.\n\n      (e) A disclosure described in paragraph (c) of this subsection does not release the landlord from the duties imposed by this chapter, including the duty to maintain the dwelling unit in a habitable condition pursuant to ORS 90.320 or 90.730. A tenant who enters into a tenancy after the landlord’s disclosure does not waive the tenant’s other remedies under this chapter. The disclosure does not prevent the governmental agency that made the determination from imposing on the landlord any penalty authorized by law for entering into the new tenancy.\n\n      (4)(a) If a governmental agency has made a determination regarding a dwelling unit and has posted or given notice for conditions described in subsection (2)(a) or (3)(a) of this section, a landlord may not accept from an applicant for that dwelling unit a deposit to secure the execution of a rental agreement pursuant to ORS 90.297 unless, before accepting the deposit, the landlord discloses to the applicant as provided by subsection (3)(c) of this section that the dwelling unit has been determined to be unlawful to occupy.\n\n      (b) If a landlord knowingly violates paragraph (a) of this subsection or fails to correct the conditions leading to the agency’s determination before the date a new tenancy is to begin as provided by the agreement to secure the execution of a rental agreement, an applicant may terminate the agreement to secure the execution of the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice of the termination and the reason for termination. As a result of a termination, the applicant may recover from the landlord an amount equal to twice the deposit. If an applicant recovers damages for a violation pursuant to this paragraph, the applicant may not recover any amounts under ORS 90.297.\n\n      (5) If, after a landlord and a tenant have entered into a tenancy, a governmental agency posts a dwelling unit as unsafe and unlawful to occupy due to the existence of conditions that violate state or local law, that materially affect health or safety and that:\n\n      (a) Were not caused by the tenant, the tenant may immediately terminate the tenancy by giving the landlord actual notice of the termination and the reason for the termination; or\n\n      (b) Were not caused by the landlord or by the landlord’s failure to maintain the dwelling, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving the tenant 24 hours’ written notice of the termination and the reason for the termination, after which the landlord may take possession in the manner provided in ORS 105.100 to 105.168.\n\n      (6) If the tenancy is terminated, as a result of conditions as described in subsections (2), (4) and (5) of this section, within 14 days of the notice of termination the landlord shall return to the applicant or tenant:\n\n      (a) All of the deposit to secure the execution of a rental agreement, security deposit or prepaid rent owed to the applicant under this section or to the tenant under ORS 90.300; and\n\n      (b) All rent prepaid for the month in which the termination occurs, prorated, if applicable, to the date of termination or the date the tenant vacates the premises, whichever is later.\n\n      (7) If conditions at premises that existed at the outset of the tenancy and that were not caused by the tenant pose an imminent and serious threat to the health or safety of occupants of the premises within six months from the beginning of the tenancy, the tenant may immediately terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice of the termination and the reason for the termination. In addition, if the landlord knew or should have reasonably known of the existence of the conditions, the tenant may recover either two months’ periodic rent or twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant as a result of the violation, whichever is greater. The tenant need not terminate the rental agreement to recover damages under this section. Within four days of the tenant’s notice of termination, the landlord shall return to the tenant:\n\n      (a) All of the security deposit or prepaid rent owed to the tenant under ORS 90.300; and\n\n      (b) All rent prepaid for the month in which the termination occurs, prorated to the date of termination or the date the tenant vacates the premises, whichever is later.\n\n      (8)(a) A landlord shall return the money due the applicant or tenant under subsections (6) and (7) of this section either by making the money available to the applicant or tenant at the landlord’s customary place of business or by mailing the money by first class mail to the applicant or tenant.\n\n      (b) The applicant or tenant has the option of choosing the method for return of any money due under this section. If the applicant or tenant fails to choose one of these methods at the time of giving the notice of termination, the landlord shall use the mail method, addressed to the last-known address of the applicant or tenant and mailed within the relevant four-day or 14-day period following the applicant’s or tenant’s notice.\n\n      (9) If the landlord fails to comply with subsection (8) of this section, the applicant or tenant may recover the money due in an amount equal to twice the amount due.

For purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk to others. An act that is outrageous in the extreme is more extreme or serious than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392. Acts that are “outrageous in the extreme” include, but are not limited to, the following acts by a person:\n\n      (A) Prostitution, commercial sexual solicitation or promoting prostitution, as described in ORS 167.007, 167.008 and 167.012;\n\n      (B) Unlawful manufacture, delivery or possession of a controlled substance, as defined in ORS 475.005;\n\n      (C) Manufacture of a cannabinoid extract, as defined in ORS 475C.009, unless the person manufacturing the cannabinoid extract holds a license issued under ORS 475C.085 or is registered under ORS 475C.815;\n\n      (D) A bias crime, as described in ORS 166.155 and 166.165; or\n\n      (E) Burglary as described in ORS 164.215 and 164.225.\n\n      (2) If the cause for a termination notice given pursuant to subsection (1) of this section is based upon the acts of the tenant’s pet, the tenant may cure the cause and avoid termination of the tenancy by removing the pet from the premises prior to the end of the notice period. The notice must describe the right of the tenant to cure the cause. If the tenant returns the pet to the premises at any time after having cured the violation, the landlord, after at least 24 hours’ written notice specifying the subsequent presence of the offending pet, may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in ORS 105.100 to 105.168. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation.\n\n      (3) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, someone is in the tenant’s control if that person enters or remains on the premises with the tenant’s permission or consent after the tenant reasonably knows or should know of that person’s act or likelihood to commit any act of the type described in subsection (1) of this section.\n\n      (4) An act can be proven to be outrageous in the extreme even if the act is one that does not violate a criminal statute. Notwithstanding the references to criminal statutes in subsection (1)(f) of this section, the landlord’s burden of proof in an action for possession under subsection (1) of this section is the civil standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n      (5) If a good faith effort by a landlord to terminate the tenancy under subsection (1)(f) of this section and to recover possession of the rental unit under ORS 105.100 to 105.168 fails by decision of the court, the landlord may not be found in violation of any state statute or local ordinance requiring the landlord to remove that tenant upon threat of fine, abatement or forfeiture as long as the landlord continues to make a good faith effort to terminate the tenancy.

Acceptance by a landlord of such payment does not operate to create or reinstate a tenancy or create a waiver pursuant to ORS 90.412 or 90.417.\n\n      (9) Except as provided in subsections (18) to (20) of this section, if the tenant, lienholder or owner of a recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home does not respond within the time provided by the landlord’s notice, or the tenant, lienholder or owner does not remove the personal property within the time required by subsection (8) of this section or by any date agreed to with the landlord, whichever is later, the tenant’s, lienholder’s or owner’s personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned. The tenant and any lienholder or owner that have been given notice pursuant to subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall, except with regard to the distribution of sale proceeds pursuant to subsection (13) of this section, have no further right, title or interest to the personal property and may not claim or sell the property.\n\n      (10) If the personal property is presumed to be abandoned under subsection (9) of this section, the landlord then may:\n\n      (a) Sell the personal property at a public or private sale, provided that prior to the sale of a recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home:\n\n      (A) The landlord may seek to transfer ownership of record of the personal property by complying with the requirements of the appropriate state agency; and\n\n      (B) The landlord shall:\n\n      (i) Place a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home is located. The notice shall state:\n\n      (I) That the recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home is abandoned;\n\n      (II) The tenant’s and owner’s name, if of record or actually known to the landlord;\n\n      (III) The address and any space number where the recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home is located, and any plate, registration or other identification number for a recreational vehicle or floating home noted on the certificate of title, if actually known to the landlord;\n\n      (IV) Whether the sale is by private bidding or public auction;\n\n      (V) Whether the landlord is accepting sealed bids and, if so, the last date on which bids will be accepted; and\n\n      (VI) The name and telephone number of the person to contact to inspect the recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home;\n\n      (ii) At a reasonable time prior to the sale, give a copy of the notice required by sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph to the tenant and to any lienholder and owner, by personal delivery or first class mail, except that for any lienholder, mail service must be by first class mail with certificate of mailing;\n\n      (iii) Obtain an affidavit of publication from the newspaper to show that the notice required under sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph ran in the newspaper at least one day in each of two consecutive weeks prior to the date scheduled for the sale or the last date bids will be accepted; and\n\n      (iv) Obtain written proof from the county that all property taxes and assessments on the manufactured dwelling or floating home have been paid or, if not paid, that the county has authorized the sale, with the sale proceeds to be distributed pursuant to subsection (13) of this section;\n\n      (b) Destroy or otherwise dispose of the personal property if the landlord determines that:\n\n      (A) For a manufactured dwelling or floating home, the current market value of the property is $8,000 or less as determined by the county assessor;\n\n      (B) For a recreational vehicle, the current market value of the vehicle is $4,000 or less; or\n\n      (C) For all other personal property, the reasonable current fair market value is $1,000 or less or so low that the cost of storage and conducting a public sale probably exceeds the amount that would be realized from the sale; or\n\n      (c) Consistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, sell certain items and destroy or otherwise dispose of the remaining personal property.\n\n      (11)(a) A public or private sale authorized by this section must:\n\n      (A) For a recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home, be conducted consistent with the terms listed in subsection (10)(a)(B)(i) of this section. Every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable; or\n\n      (B) For all other personal property, be conducted under the provisions of ORS 79.0610.\n\n      (b) If there is no buyer at a sale of a manufactured dwelling or floating home, the personal property is considered to be worth $8,000 or less, regardless of current market value, and the landlord shall destroy or otherwise dispose of the personal property.\n\n      (12) Notwithstanding ORS 446.155 (1) and (2), unless a landlord intentionally misrepresents the condition of a manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord is not liable for the condition of the dwelling or home to:\n\n      (a) A buyer of the dwelling or home at a sale pursuant to subsection (10)(a) of this section, with or without consideration; or\n\n      (b) A person or nonprofit organization to whom the landlord gives the dwelling or home pursuant to subsection (1)(b), (10)(b) or (11)(b) of this section.\n\n      (13)(a) The landlord may deduct from the proceeds of the sale:\n\n      (A) The reasonable or actual cost of notice, storage and sale; and\n\n      (B) Unpaid rent.\n\n      (b) If the sale was of a manufactured dwelling or floating home, after deducting the amounts listed in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the landlord shall remit the remaining proceeds, if any, to the county tax collector to the extent of any unpaid property taxes and assessments owed on the dwelling or home.\n\n      (c) If the sale was of a recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home, after deducting the amounts listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, if applicable, the landlord shall remit the remaining proceeds, if any, to any lienholder to the extent of any unpaid balance owed on the lien on the recreational vehicle, dwelling or home.\n\n      (d) After deducting the amounts listed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection, if applicable, the landlord shall remit to the tenant or owner the remaining proceeds, if any, together with an itemized accounting.\n\n      (e) If the tenant or owner cannot after due diligence be found, the landlord shall deposit the remaining proceeds with the county treasurer of the county in which the sale occurred. If not claimed within three years, the deposited proceeds revert to the general fund of the county and are available for general purposes.\n\n      (14) The county tax collector shall cancel all unpaid property taxes and assessments owed on a manufactured dwelling or floating home, as provided under ORS 311.790, only under one of the following circumstances:\n\n      (a) The landlord disposes of the manufactured dwelling or floating home after a determination described in subsection (10)(b) of this section.\n\n      (b) There is no buyer of the manufactured dwelling or floating home at a sale described under subsection (11) of this section.\n\n      (c)(A) There is a buyer of the manufactured dwelling or floating home at a sale described under subsection (11) of this section;\n\n      (B) The current market value of the manufactured dwelling or floating home is $8,000 or less; and\n\n      (C) The proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes and assessments owed on the dwelling or home after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to subsection (13) of this section.\n\n      (d)(A) The landlord buys the manufactured dwelling or floating home at a sale described under subsection (11) of this section;\n\n      (B) The current market value of the manufactured dwelling or floating home is more than $8,000;\n\n      (C) The proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes and assessments owed on the manufactured dwelling or floating home after distribution of the proceeds pursuant to subsection (13) of this section; and\n\n      (D) The landlord disposes of the manufactured dwelling or floating home.\n\n      (15) The landlord is not responsible for any loss to the tenant, lienholder or owner resulting from storage of personal property in compliance with this section unless the loss was caused by the landlord’s deliberate or negligent act. In the event of a deliberate and malicious violation, the landlord is liable for twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant, lienholder or owner.\n\n      (16) Complete compliance in good faith with this section shall constitute a complete defense in any action brought by a tenant, lienholder or owner against a landlord for loss or damage to such personal property disposed of pursuant to this section.\n\n      (17) If a landlord does not comply with this section:\n\n      (a) The tenant is relieved of any liability for damage to the premises caused by conduct that was not deliberate, intentional or grossly negligent and for unpaid rent and may recover from the landlord up to twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant;\n\n      (b) A lienholder or owner aggrieved by the noncompliance may recover from the landlord the actual damages sustained by the lienholder or owner. ORS 90.255 does not authorize an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this paragraph; and\n\n      (c) A county tax collector aggrieved by the noncompliance may recover from the landlord the actual damages sustained by the tax collector, if the noncompliance is part of an effort by the landlord to defraud the tax collector. ORS 90.255 does not authorize an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this paragraph.\n\n      (18) In the case of an abandoned recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home, the provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a tenant to the abandoned vehicle, dwelling or home also apply to any lienholder except that the lienholder may not sell or remove the vehicle, dwelling or home unless:\n\n      (a) The lienholder has foreclosed its lien on the recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home;\n\n      (b) The tenant or a personal representative or designated person described in subsection (20) of this section has waived all rights under this section pursuant to subsection (26) of this section; or\n\n      (c) The notice and response periods provided by subsections (6) and (8) of this section have expired.\n\n      (19)(a) In the case of an abandoned manufactured dwelling or floating home but not including a dwelling or home abandoned following a termination pursuant to ORS 90.429 and except as provided by subsection (20)(d) and (e) of this section, if a lienholder makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned personal property pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so requests, a landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the lienholder providing that the dwelling or home may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 12 months. A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.\n\n      (b) The lienholder’s right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the tenant, owner or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal representative, designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the dwelling or home within the allotted time.\n\n      (c) To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the lienholder. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the lienholder in the same manner as provided by subsection (4)(b) of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (4) of this section. A lienholder enters into a storage agreement by signing a copy of the agreement provided by the landlord and personally delivering or mailing the signed copy to the landlord within the 60-day period.\n\n      (d) The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by the landlord and the lienholder, that:\n\n      (A) The lienholder make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as described in subsection (7)(d) of this section, accruing from the commencement of the 45-day period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.562, if limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due more frequently than monthly;\n\n      (B) The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no greater than for late charges described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant; and\n\n      (C) The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant.\n\n      (e) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord’s approval of a purchaser or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval of any purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.\n\n      (f)(A) If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 90 days’ written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling or home without further notice to the lienholder.\n\n      (B) After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for failure of the lienholder to pay a storage charge and the lienholder corrects the violation, if the lienholder again violates the storage agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.\n\n      (C) A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14 days’ written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the rented space if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges as provided in the agreement.\n\n      (g) Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the lienholder.\n\n      (20) If the personal property is a manufactured dwelling or floating home and is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant and who owned the dwelling or home, this section applies, except as follows:\n\n      (a) The following persons have the same rights and responsibilities regarding the abandoned dwelling or home as a tenant:\n\n      (A) Any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for the deceased tenant.\n\n      (B) Any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant’s death.\n\n      (b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:\n\n      (A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; and\n\n      (B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative or designated person, if actually known to the landlord.\n\n      (c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to any personal representative or designated person, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.\n\n      (d) If a personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the property, such as an heir or devisee, responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided by subsection (6) of this section and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the dwelling or home may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later. A storage agreement entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to subsection (19) of this section until the agreement with the personal representative or designated person ends.\n\n      (e) If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement, subsection (19)(c), (d) and (f)(C) of this section applies, with the representative or person having the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.\n\n      (f) During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the dwelling or home, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord’s approval for occupancy of a purchaser, heir or devisee or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee of the dwelling or home upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.\n\n      (g) If the representative or person violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to the representative or person stating facts sufficient to notify the representative or person of the reason for the termination. Unless the representative or person corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling or home without further notice to the representative or person.\n\n      (h) Upon the failure of a representative or person to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative or person has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the representative or person.\n\n      (21) If the personal property is other than a manufactured dwelling or floating home and is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant and who owned the personal property, this section applies except as follows:\n\n      (a) The following persons have the same rights and responsibilities regarding the abandoned personal property as a tenant:\n\n      (A) An heir or devisee.\n\n      (B) Any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for the deceased tenant.\n\n      (C) Any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant’s death.\n\n      (b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:\n\n      (A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises;\n\n      (B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any heir, devisee, personal representative or designated person, if actually known to the landlord; and\n\n      (C) Sent by first class mail to the attention of an estate administrator of the State Treasurer.\n\n      (c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to the heir, devisee, personal representative, designated person or estate administrator of the State Treasurer, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.\n\n      (d) The landlord shall allow a person that is an heir, devisee or personal representative of the tenant, or an estate administrator of the State Treasurer, to remove the personal property if the person contacts the landlord within the period provided by subsection (6) of this section, complies with the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence that the person is an heir, devisee or personal representative, or an estate administrator of the State Treasurer.\n\n      (e) If no heir, devisee or personal representative of the tenant, or no estate administrator of the State Treasurer, contacts the landlord within the time period provided by subsection (6) of this section, the landlord shall allow removal of the personal property by the designated person of the tenant, if the designated person contacts the landlord within that period and complies with the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence that the person is the designated person.\n\n      (f) A landlord who allows removal of personal property under this subsection is not liable to another person that has a claim or interest in the personal property.\n\n      (22) If a governmental agency determines that the condition of a manufactured dwelling or floating home abandoned under this section constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law and the agency determines that the hazard endangers others in the immediate vicinity and requires quick removal of the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this subsection. The landlord shall comply with all provisions of this section, except as follows:\n\n      (a) The date provided in subsection (6) of this section by which a tenant, lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person must contact a landlord to arrange for the disposition of the property must be not less than 15 days after personal delivery or mailing of the notice required by subsection (3) of this section.\n\n      (b) The date provided in subsections (8) and (9) of this section by which a tenant, lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person must remove the property must be not less than seven days after the tenant, lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person contacts the landlord.\n\n      (c) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be as provided in subsection (5) of this section, except that:\n\n      (A) The dates and deadlines in the notice for contacting the landlord and removing the property must be consistent with this subsection;\n\n      (B) The notice must state that a governmental agency has determined that the property constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard and must be removed quickly; and\n\n      (C) The landlord shall attach a copy of the agency’s determination to the notice.\n\n      (d) If the tenant, a lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person does not remove the property within the time allowed, the landlord or a buyer at a sale by the landlord under subsection (11) of this section shall promptly remove the property from the facility.\n\n      (e) A landlord is not required to enter into a storage agreement with a lienholder, owner, personal representative or designated person pursuant to subsection (19) of this section.\n\n      (23)(a) If an official or agency referred to in ORS 453.876 notifies the landlord that the official or agency has determined that all or part of the premises is unfit for use as a result of the presence of an illegal drug manufacturing site involving methamphetamine, and the landlord complies with this subsection, the landlord is not required to comply with subsections (1) to (22) and (24) to (27) of this section with regard to personal property left on the portion of the premises that the official or agency has determined to be unfit for use.\n\n      (b) Upon receiving notice from an official or agency determining the premises to be unfit for use, the landlord shall promptly give written notice to the tenant as provided in subsection (3) of this section. The landlord shall also attach a copy of the notice in a secure manner to the main entrance of the dwelling unit. The notice to the tenant shall include a copy of the official’s or agency’s notice and state:\n\n      (A) That the premises, or a portion of the premises, has been determined by an official or agency to be unfit for use due to contamination from the manufacture of methamphetamine and that as a result subsections (1) to (22) and (24) to (27) of this section do not apply to personal property left on any portion of the premises determined to be unfit for use;\n\n      (B) That the landlord has hired, or will hire, a contractor to assess the level of contamination of the site and to decontaminate the site;\n\n      (C) That upon hiring the contractor, the landlord will provide to the tenant the name, address and telephone number of the contractor; and\n\n      (D) That the tenant may contact the contractor to determine whether any of the tenant’s personal property may be removed from the premises or may be decontaminated at the tenant’s expense and then removed.\n\n      (c) To the extent consistent with rules of the Department of Human Services, the contractor may release personal property to the tenant.\n\n      (d) If the contractor and the department determine that the premises or the tenant’s personal property is not unfit for use, upon notification by the department of the determination, the landlord shall comply with subsections (1) to (22) and (24) to (27) of this section for any personal property left on the premises.\n\n      (e) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, the landlord is not responsible for storing or returning any personal property left on the portion of the premises that is unfit for use.\n\n      (24) In the case of an abandoned recreational vehicle, manufactured dwelling or floating home that is owned by someone other than the tenant, the provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a tenant to the abandoned vehicle, dwelling or home also apply to that owner, with regard only to the vehicle, dwelling or home, and not to any goods left inside or outside the vehicle, dwelling or home.\n\n      (25) In the case of an abandoned motor vehicle, including a recreational vehicle, the procedure authorized by ORS 98.830 for removal of abandoned motor vehicles from private property may be used by a landlord as an alternative to the procedures required in this section.\n\n      (26)(a) A landlord may sell or dispose of a tenant’s abandoned personal property without complying with subsections (1) to (25) and (27) of this section if, after termination of the tenancy or no more than seven days prior to the termination of the tenancy, the following parties so agree in a writing entered into in good faith:\n\n      (A) The landlord;\n\n      (B) The tenant, or for an abandonment as the result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant, the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the personal property, such as an heir or devisee, as described in subsection (20) or (21) of this section; and\n\n      (C) In the case of a manufactured dwelling, floating home or recreational vehicle, any owner and any lienholder.\n\n      (b) A landlord may not, as part of a rental agreement, require a tenant, a personal representative, a designated person or any lienholder or owner to waive any right provided by this section.\n\n      (27) Until personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned under subsection (9) of this section, a landlord does not have a lien pursuant to ORS 87.152 for storing the personal property.

The plan may include only the landlord’s actual costs to be recovered on a pro rata basis from each tenant with payments due no more frequently than monthly over a period of at least 60 months. Payments must be itemized as a separate charge from the utility or service charge. The landlord must give each tenant a copy of the plan at least 90 days before the first payment is due. Payments may not be due before the completion of the installation, and must begin within six months after completion. A new tenant of a space subject to the plan may be required to make payments under the plan. Payments must end when the plan ends.

If the landlord continues to use rent-included billing for common areas, the landlord may offset against the rent reduction required by subsection (6) of this section an amount that reflects the cost of serving the common areas. If the utility or service provider cannot provide an accurate cost for the service to the common areas, the landlord shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed.

ORS 90.255 does not authorize an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this paragraph.\n\n      (19) The provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a tenant to the abandoned personal property also apply to any lienholder, except that the lienholder may not sell or remove the dwelling or home unless:\n\n      (a) The lienholder has foreclosed the lien on the manufactured dwelling or floating home;\n\n      (b) The tenant or a personal representative or designated person described in subsection (21) of this section has waived all rights under this section pursuant to subsection (24) of this section; or\n\n      (c) The notice and response periods provided by subsections (6) and (8) of this section have expired.\n\n      (20)(a) Except as provided by subsection (21)(d) and (e) of this section, if a lienholder makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned personal property pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so requests, a landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the lienholder providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 12 months. A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.\n\n      (b) The lienholder’s right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the tenant or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal representative, designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the dwelling or home within the allotted time.\n\n      (c) To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the lienholder. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the lienholder in the same manner as provided by subsection (4)(b) of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (4) of this section. A lienholder enters into a storage agreement by signing a copy of the agreement provided by the landlord and personally delivering or mailing the signed copy to the landlord within the 60-day period. If the tenancy is in a marina, the proposed storage agreement is conditioned upon the tenant not electing to enter into a storage agreement under subsection (22) of this section.\n\n      (d) The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by the landlord and the lienholder, that:\n\n      (A) The lienholder make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as described in subsection (7)(b) of this section, accruing from the commencement of the 45-day period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.562, if limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due more frequently than monthly;\n\n      (B) The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no greater than for late charges imposed on facility tenants;\n\n      (C) The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the rental agreement that the landlord currently provides to tenants as required by ORS 90.510 (4); and\n\n      (D) The lienholder repair any defects in the physical condition of the personal property that existed prior to the lienholder entering into the storage agreement, if the defects and necessary repairs are reasonably described in the storage agreement and, for homes that were first placed on the space within the previous 24 months, the repairs are reasonably consistent with facility standards in effect at the time of placement. The lienholder shall have 90 days after entering into the storage agreement to make the repairs. Failure to make the repairs within the allotted time constitutes a violation of the storage agreement and the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 14 days’ written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.\n\n      (e) Notwithstanding subsection (7)(b) of this section, a landlord may increase the storage charge if the increase is part of a facility-wide rent increase for all facility tenants, the increase is no greater than the increase for other tenants and the landlord gives the lienholder written notice consistent with the requirements of ORS 90.600.\n\n      (f) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680. The landlord may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.\n\n      (g)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(D) of this subsection, if the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 90 days’ written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.\n\n      (B) After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for failure of the lienholder to pay a storage charge and the lienholder corrects the violation, if the lienholder again violates the storage agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.\n\n      (C) A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14 days’ written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the facility if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges as provided in the agreement.\n\n      (h) Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the lienholder.\n\n      (21) If the personal property is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant, this section applies, except as follows:\n\n      (a) The provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a tenant to the abandoned personal property shall apply to any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for the deceased tenant or any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant’s death.\n\n      (b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:\n\n      (A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; and\n\n      (B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative or designated person if actually known to the landlord.\n\n      (c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to any personal representative or designated person, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.\n\n      (d) If a personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the property, such as an heir or devisee, responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided by subsection (6) of this section and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later. A storage agreement entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to subsection (20) of this section until the agreement with the personal representative or designated person ends.\n\n      (e) If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement, subsection (20)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of this section applies, with the representative or person having the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.\n\n      (f) During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.\n\n      (g) If the representative or person violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to the representative or person stating facts sufficient to notify the representative or person of the reason for the termination. Unless the representative or person corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the representative or person.\n\n      (h) Upon the failure of a representative or person to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative or person has sold or removed the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the representative or person.\n\n      (22)(a) If a tenant of a marina makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned personal property pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so requests, and has not entered into a storage agreement under ORS 90.545 (7), a landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the tenant providing that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 12 months. A storage agreement entitles the tenant to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.\n\n      (b) To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the tenant must enter into the proposed storage agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the tenant. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the tenant in the same manner as provided by subsection (3) of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (3) of this section. A tenant enters into a storage agreement by signing a copy of the agreement provided by the landlord and personally delivering or mailing the signed copy to the landlord within the 60-day period.\n\n      (c) The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by the landlord and the tenant, that:\n\n      (A) The tenant make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as described in subsection (7)(b) of this section, accruing from the commencement of the 45-day period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.562, if limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due more frequently than monthly.\n\n      (B) The tenant pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no greater than for late charges imposed on facility tenants.\n\n      (C) The tenant maintain the personal property and the space on which the personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the rental agreement that the landlord currently provides to tenants as required by ORS 90.510 (4).\n\n      (D) The tenant repair any defects in the physical condition of the personal property that existed prior to the tenant entering into the storage agreement, except repair the float of the home, if the defects and necessary repairs are reasonably described in the storage agreement and, for homes that were first placed on the space within the previous 24 months, the repairs are reasonably consistent with facility standards in effect at the time of placement. The tenant shall have 90 days after entering into the storage agreement to make the repairs. Failure to make the repairs within the allotted time constitutes a violation of the storage agreement and the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 14 days’ written notice to the tenant stating facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the reason for termination. Unless the tenant corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the tenant.\n\n      (d) Notwithstanding subsection (7)(b) of this section, a landlord may increase the storage charge if the increase is part of a facility-wide rent increase for all facility tenants, the increase is no greater than the increase for other tenants and the landlord gives the tenant written notice consistent with the requirements of ORS 90.600.\n\n      (e) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the tenant has the right to remove or sell the property. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680. The landlord may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.\n\n      (f)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(D) of this subsection, if the tenant violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 90 days’ written notice to the tenant stating facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the reason for the termination. Unless the tenant corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the tenant.\n\n      (B) After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for failure of the tenant to pay a storage charge and the tenant corrects the violation, if the tenant again violates the storage agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to the tenant stating facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the reason for termination. Unless the tenant corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the tenant.\n\n      (C) A tenant may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14 days’ written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the facility if the tenant has paid all storage charges and other charges as provided in the agreement.\n\n      (g) Upon the failure of a tenant to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the tenant after providing at least 15 days’ written notice to any lienholder to enter into a storage agreement under subsection (20) of this section.\n\n      (23) If a governmental agency determines that the condition of personal property abandoned under this section constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law and the agency determines that the hazard endangers others in the facility and requires quick removal of the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this subsection. The landlord shall comply with all provisions of this section, except as follows:\n\n      (a) The date provided in subsection (6) of this section by which a tenant, lienholder, personal representative or designated person must contact a landlord to arrange for the disposition of the property must be not less than 15 days after personal delivery or mailing of the notice required by subsection (3) of this section.\n\n      (b) The date provided in subsections (8) and (9) of this section by which a tenant, lienholder, personal representative or designated person must remove the property must be not less than seven days after the tenant, lienholder, personal representative or designated person contacts the landlord.\n\n      (c) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be as provided in subsection (5) of this section, except that:\n\n      (A) The dates and deadlines in the notice for contacting the landlord and removing the property must be consistent with this subsection;\n\n      (B) The notice must state that a governmental agency has determined that the property constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard and must be removed quickly; and\n\n      (C) The landlord shall attach a copy of the agency’s determination to the notice.\n\n      (d) If the tenant, a lienholder or a personal representative or designated person does not remove the property within the time allowed, the landlord or a buyer at a sale by the landlord under subsection (11) of this section shall promptly remove the property from the facility.\n\n      (e) A landlord is not required to enter into a storage agreement with a lienholder, personal representative or designated person pursuant to subsection (20) of this section.\n\n      (24)(a) A landlord may sell or dispose of a tenant’s abandoned personal property without complying with the provisions of this section if, after termination of the tenancy or no more than seven days prior to the termination of the tenancy, the following parties so agree in a writing entered into in good faith:\n\n      (A) The landlord;\n\n      (B) The tenant, or for an abandonment as the result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant, the personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the personal property, such as an heir or devisee, as described in subsection (21) of this section; and\n\n      (C) Any lienholder.\n\n      (b) A landlord may not, as part of a rental agreement, as a condition to approving a sale of property on rented space under ORS 90.680 or in any other manner, require a tenant, a personal representative, a designated person or any lienholder to waive any right provided by this section.\n\n      (25) Until personal property is conclusively presumed to be abandoned under subsection (9) of this section, a landlord does not have a lien pursuant to ORS 87.152 for storing the personal property.

(1) As used in this section, “consignment” means an agreement in which a tenant authorizes a landlord to sell a manufactured dwelling or floating home on behalf of the tenant who owns the dwelling or home in a facility that is owned by the landlord and for which the landlord receives compensation.\n\n      (2) A landlord may not deny any manufactured dwelling or floating home space tenant the right to sell a manufactured dwelling or floating home on a rented space or require the tenant to remove the dwelling or home from the space solely on the basis of the sale.\n\n      (3) A landlord may not require, as a condition of a tenant’s occupancy, consignment of the tenant’s manufactured dwelling or floating home.\n\n      (4)(a) A landlord may sell a tenant’s manufactured dwelling or floating home on consignment only if:\n\n      (A) The sale involves a dwelling in a facility and the landlord is licensed to sell dwellings under ORS 446.661 to 446.756.

An application is not complete until the prospective purchaser pays any required applicant screening charge and provides the landlord with all information and documentation, including any financial data and references, required by the landlord pursuant to ORS 90.510 (5)(i). The landlord and the prospective purchaser may agree to a longer time period for the landlord to evaluate the prospective purchaser’s application or to allow the prospective purchaser to address any failure to meet the landlord’s screening or admission criteria. If a tenant has not previously given the landlord the 10 days’ notice required under subsection (8)(a) of this section, the period provided for the landlord to accept or reject a complete and accurate written application is extended to 10 days.\n\n      (b) When a landlord considers an application for tenancy from a prospective purchaser of a dwelling or home from a tenant, the landlord shall apply to the prospective purchaser credit and conduct screening criteria that are substantially similar to the credit and conduct screening criteria the landlord applies to a prospective purchaser of a dwelling or home from the landlord.\n\n      (c) The landlord may not unreasonably reject a prospective purchaser as a tenant. Reasonable cause for rejection includes, but is not limited to, failure of the prospective purchaser to meet the landlord’s conditions for approval as provided in ORS 90.510 (5)(i) or failure of the prospective purchaser’s references to respond to the landlord’s timely request for verification within the time allowed for acceptance or rejection under paragraph (a) of this subsection. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, the landlord shall furnish to the seller and purchaser a written statement of the reasons for the rejection.\n\n      (d) If a rejection under paragraph (c) of this subsection is based upon a consumer report, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1681a for purposes of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the landlord may not disclose the contents of the report to anyone other than the purchaser. The landlord shall disclose to the seller in writing that the rejection is based upon information contained within a consumer report and that the landlord may not disclose the information within the report.\n\n      (11) The following apply if a landlord does not require a prospective purchaser to submit an application for occupancy as a tenant under subsection (8) of this section or if the landlord does not accept or reject the prospective purchaser as a tenant within the time required under subsection (10) of this section:\n\n      (a) The landlord waives any right to bring an action against the tenant under the rental agreement for breach of the landlord’s right to establish conditions upon and approve a prospective purchaser of the tenant’s dwelling or home;\n\n      (b) The prospective purchaser, upon completion of the sale, may occupy the dwelling or home as a tenant under the same conditions and terms as the tenant who sold the dwelling or home; and\n\n      (c) If the prospective purchaser becomes a new tenant, the landlord may impose conditions or terms on the tenancy that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the seller’s rental agreement only if the new tenant agrees in writing.\n\n      (12) A landlord may not, because of the age, size, style or original construction material of the dwelling or home or because the dwelling or home was built prior to adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5403), in compliance with the standards of that Act in effect at that time or in compliance with the state building code as defined in ORS 455.010:\n\n      (a) Reject an application for tenancy from a prospective purchaser of an existing dwelling or home on a rented space within a facility; or\n\n      (b) Require a prospective purchaser of an existing dwelling or home on a rented space within a facility to remove the dwelling or home from the rented space.\n\n      (13) A tenant who has received a notice pursuant to ORS 90.632 may sell the tenant’s dwelling or home in compliance with this section during the notice period. The tenant shall provide a prospective purchaser with a copy of any outstanding notice given to the tenant under ORS 90.632 prior to a sale. If the tenancy has been terminated pursuant to ORS 90.632, or the notice period provided in ORS 90.632 has expired without a correction of cause or extension of time to correct, a prospective purchaser does not have a right to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.\n\n      (14) The following applies to a landlord that accepts a prospective purchaser as a tenant under subsection (10) of this section:\n\n      (a) Notwithstanding any waiver given by the landlord to the previous tenant, the landlord may require the new tenant to complete the repairs, maintenance and improvements described in the notices provided under subsection (9)(a)(B) to (D) of this section.\n\n      (b) Notwithstanding ORS 90.412, if the new tenant fails to complete the repairs, maintenance and improvements described in the notices provided under subsection (9)(a)(B) to (D) of this section within six months after the tenancy begins, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving the new tenant the notice required under ORS 90.630 or 90.632.\n\n      (15) Except as provided by subsection (13) of this section, after a tenancy has ended and during the period provided by ORS 90.675 (6) and (8), a former tenant retains the right to sell the tenant’s dwelling or home to a purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant as provided by this section, if the former tenant makes timely periodic payment of all storage charges as provided by ORS 90.675 (7)(b), maintains the dwelling or home and the rented space on which it is stored and enters the premises only with the written permission of the landlord. Payment of the storage charges or maintenance of the dwelling or home and the space does not create or reinstate a tenancy or create a waiver pursuant to ORS 90.412 or 90.417. A former tenant may not enter the premises without the written permission of the landlord, including entry to maintain the dwelling or home or the space or to facilitate a sale.\n\n      (16) A landlord or tenant who sells a manufactured dwelling or floating home shall deliver title to the dwelling or home to the purchaser within 25 business days after completion of the sale. If the sale by contract requires future payments, the landlord or tenant shall notify the county that the purchaser is responsible for property tax payments.

One housing alternative chosen by many Oregonians is facility living. The Legislative Assembly finds that many facility tenants would like to join together, alone or in cooperation with an associated entity, to purchase the facility in which the tenants live in order to have greater control over the costs and environment of their housing. The Legislative Assembly also finds that current market conditions place tenants at a disadvantage with other potential investors in the purchase of facilities.\n\n      (2) It is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage facility tenants to participate in the housing marketplace by ensuring that technical assistance, financing opportunities, notice of sale of facilities and the option to purchase facilities are made available to tenants who choose to participate in the purchase of a facility.\n\n      (3) The purpose of ORS 90.800 to 90.850, 456.579 and 456.581 is to strengthen the private housing market in Oregon by encouraging all Oregonians to have the ability to participate in the purchase of housing of their choice.

property subject of the complaint because:\n\n      ______ The defendant(s) did not take and do not have possession of any of the property listed in the complaint.\n\n      ______ The defendant(s) took possession of the personal property as provided in ORS 90.425 or 90.675 after giving written notice that it was considered abandoned, and the plaintiff(s) did not make a timely demand for return of the property.\n\n      ______ The defendant(s) took possession of the personal property as provided in ORS 90.425 or 90.675 after giving written notice that it was considered abandoned, but not after a sheriff’s enforcement of an eviction judgment against the plaintiff(s) as provided in ORS 105.165, and the plaintiff(s) refused to pay charges lawfully due for storage.\n\n \n\n______ Other: ______________\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\n      I (we)

defendant(s)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n \n\n      (d) The issue at trial shall be limited to whether the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the personal property listed in the complaint.\n\n      (e) No claim for damages shall be asserted by either party in the action for possession of the personal property under this section, but each party may pursue any claim for damages in a separate action.\n\n      (f) A party may join an action for possession of personal property with an action for damages or a claim for other relief, but the proceeding is not governed by the provisions of ORS 105.100 to 105.168.\n\n      (g) If the court determines that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the personal property that is the subject of the complaint, the court shall enter an order directing the sheriff to seize the personal property to which the court finds the plaintiff entitled, and to deliver that property to the plaintiff. The court may provide that the defendant have a period of time to deliver the property to the plaintiff voluntarily before execution. The costs of execution may be recovered in the manner provided in ORS 18.999.\n\n      (h) Subject to the provisions of ORCP 68, a prevailing party who has been represented by counsel may recover attorney fees as provided by ORS 90.255.

Such a contract is binding upon the minor and cannot be voided or disaffirmed by the minor based upon the minor’s age or status as a minor.\n(4)The consent of the parent or legal guardian of such minor shall not be necessary to contract for a residential dwelling unit or utility services to that unit. The parent or legal guardian of such minor shall not be liable under a contract by that minor for a residential dwelling unit or for utility services to that unit unless the parent or guardian is a party to the minor’s contract, or enters another contract, for the purpose of acting as guarantor of the minor’s debt.

{"id": "OAR54_411-054-0080", "title": "Involuntary Move-out Criteria", "content": "Involuntary Move-out Criteria\nThe Department of Human Services, Aging and People with Disabilities Office encourages facilities to support a resident's choice to remain in his or her living environment while recognizing that some residents may no longer be appropriate for the community-based care setting due to safety and medical limitations.\n(1) Information must be specified in the facility's disclosure information OAR 411-054-0026 (Notice to Potential Residents) that describes the types of health, nursing, behavior, and care services the facility is able and unable to provide. In addition, facilities endorsed under OAR chapter 411, division 057 (Endorsed Memory Care Communities) must provide services to support residents with the progressive symptoms of dementia. Facilities will not be required to permanently provide staffing beyond the staffing services stated in the residency agreement; however, facilities may need to provide additional services to residents on a short-term basis to ensure safety of residents and to facilitate transfer to a more appropriate setting. The minimum required services identified in the following sections and outlined in disclosure documents must be provided before a resident may be asked to move out:\n(a) OAR 411-054-0070(1) (Staffing).\n(b) OAR 411-054-0030 (Resident Services).\n(c) OAR 411-054-0045(1)(f)(F) (Intermittent Direct Nursing Services). Such services may be of a temporary nature as defined in the facility policy, admission agreements and disclosure information. This means the facility is not required to provide services beyond the scope of the facility license or in a manner that does not support the health and safety of the resident or others in the facility.\n(2) REASONS FOR INVOLUNTARY 30-DAY MOVE-OUT NOTICE. A resident may be asked to move from a facility if one or more of the following circumstances exists:\n(a) The resident's needs exceed the level of ADL services the facility provides as specified in the facility's disclosure information;\n(b) The resident engages in behavior or actions that repeatedly and substantially interferes with the rights, health, or safety of residents or others;\n(c) The resident has a medical or nursing condition that is complex, unstable or unpredictable, and exceeds the level of health services the facility provides as specified in the facility's disclosure information;\n(d) The facility is unable to accomplish resident evacuation in accordance with OAR 411-054-0090 (Fire and Life Safety);\n(e) The resident exhibits behavior that poses a danger to self or others;\n(f) The resident engages in illegal drug use, or commits a criminal act that causes potential harm to the resident or others; or\n(g) Non-payment of charges.\n(3) Prior to issuing a move-out notice, the facility shall communicate with the resident or resident’s legal representative regarding the reasons for the move-out and attempt to resolve the reason for move out. The facility must document efforts to resolve the move out.\n(4) PROCESS FOR ISSUING AN INVOLUNTARY 30-DAY MOVE-OUT NOTICE. Except as otherwise provided in these rules, the following apply to a 30-day move out:\n(a) A facility may not require a resident to engage in an involuntary move out from the facility without first providing 30-day notice to the resident, resident’s legal representative, the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman, and the resident’s case manager, if the resident has a case manager.\n(b) Before the facility issues a 30-day notice to the resident, the resident’s legal representative, the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman, or the resident’s case manager, the facility must first submit the written notice to the Department for review and receive a written response from the Department stating the notice and other documentation submitted by the facility complies with these rules.\n(5) As part of the facility submission of the 30-day notice to the Department as described in (4), the facility must demonstrate that the facility has made all relevant, appropriate efforts to resolve the reason(s) for the requested move-out. At a minimum, the facility must provide to the Department the following written information concerning the proposed move-out:\n(a) A copy of the proposed 30-Day Move-out and Administrative Hearing Request (form APD 0567 and form MSC 0443), which includes a written explanation of the reason(s) for the requested move out.\n(b) The two (2) most recent service plans, showing modifications made in attempt to resolve the reason for the requested move out. The only exception to this specific requirement involves any proposed move-out due to resident non-payment issues.\n(c) All relevant documentation that supports the facility’s reason(s) for the proposed 30-Day Move-out Notice.\n(6) After receiving the facility’s documentation under (5) of this rule, the Department may request additional documentation from the facility concerning the proposed move-out. Such requested documentation may include, but is not limited to:\n(a) Documentation of the facility’s attempts to resolve the reason for the proposed move-out such as related progress notes, relevant Medication Administration Record(s), evaluations, clinical assessments, physician notes, and other documentation demonstrating the facility has attempted to staff resident’s temporary or intermittent needs.\n(b) Documentation that demonstrates the proposed move-out is consistent with the facility’s:\n(A) Uniform Disclosure Statement, as required by OAR 411-054-0026(1).\n(B) Residency Agreement, as required by OAR 411-054-0026(2).\n(C) Consumer Summary Statement, as required by OAR 411-054-0026(3).\n(c) Names and contact information of additional parties or witnesses, as appropriate, to allow the Department to obtain additional facts regarding the reason for the move.\n(7) After receiving all information required under (5) and requested under (6) of this rule, the Department will have two business days to review the 30-day involuntary move out notice and any related documentation and provide the facility with written notice indicating whether or not the Department has determined the facility has provided satisfactory documentation in compliance with these rules. If the Department determines sufficient documentation has not been provided, the Department will deny the move-out notice. A denial does not prohibit a facility from submitting or resubmitting a move-out notice that satisfies the criteria contained in (5) of this rule.\n(8) The Department will provide written notice to the facility with a determination regarding the proposed move-out. However, if the Department determines regulatory criteria established in rule were not met, the facility may not issue the move-out notice.\n(9) The facility may issue the notice if the Department has determined regulatory criteria were met; the facility must email a copy of the final version of form APD 0567 to the Department, the resident, the resident's legal representative, the resident’s case manager, and the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman.\n(a) The 30-Day Move-Out and Hearing Notification form (form APD 0567) must include notice of both the move-out and the right to request a hearing (form MSC 0443).\n(b) If the correct form, containing both notices, is not delivered to all necessary parties, the 30-Day Move-Out and Hearing Notice form is insufficient, and the timeline does not start until both notices are jointly supplied.\n(10) Informal conferences and administrative hearings requested under (9) will be conducted according to (19) of this rule.\n(11) LESS THAN 30-DAY MOVE-OUT NOTICE. The resident must be given 30 days advance written notice before being asked to move out or not return to the facility, except in the following unusual circumstances:\n(a) A resident has been admitted or treated at a health care facility for a significant medical or psychiatric event. At the time the resident is to return to the facility, qualified facility staff have evaluated the resident's health, medical, behavioral or care needs and have determined the facility is unable to meet the resident's needs pursuant to section (1) of this rule due to the resident’s significant and ongoing change of condition related to a medical or psychiatric event, whether that event was the reason for leaving the facility for treatment, or arose while the resident was being treated at the health care facility.\n(A) A “significant medical or psychiatric event” is defined as a serious illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that results in a change of condition such that the facility cannot meet the needs of the resident, and the resident requires inpatient care in a health care facility on a continuing and permanent basis.\n(B) For the duration of the resident’s time in the health care facility, a facility must stay informed of the status of the resident’s health by communicating with the health care facility on a consistent, ongoing basis.\n(C) When a resident has been admitted or treated at a health care facility for a significant medical or psychiatric event, once the health care facility has given notice to the facility that the resident is ready to be discharged to return to the facility, qualified facility staff shall evaluate the resident's health, medical, behavioral or care needs within a reasonable time, but no later than 24 hours after the resident has been deemed ready for discharge.\n(b) The resident’s behavior places the health or safety of the resident or others in jeopardy and undue delay in moving the resident increases the risk of harm.\n(12) PROCESS FOR ISSUING AN INVOLUNTARY LESS THAN 30-DAY MOVE-OUT NOTICE. A facility may not issue a move-out notice before first submitting written documentation described in (13) of this rule to the Department and then receiving written response from the Department stating the written documentation submitted by the facility is in compliance with these rules.\n(13) Prior to providing notice to the resident or the resident’s legal representative, the facility must provide to the Department the following written information concerning the proposed less than 30-day move-out:\n(a) A copy of the proposed Less Than 30-Day Move-out and Hearing Notice form (form APD 0568 and form MSC 0443), which includes a written explanation of the reason(s) for the requested move out.\n(b) The two (2) most recent service plans, showing service plan modification, if possible.\n(c) Appropriate documentation that demonstrates the efforts taken to address all service needs of the resident, including providing intermittent direct nursing services or obtaining home health, hospice, or a third-party referral, as required by rule.\n(d) Documentation demonstrating compliance with 411-054-0070(1) and 411-054-0030(2)(b).\n(e) Explanation of whether the facility has the ability to respond to 24-hour care needs and also assist residents to access health care services from outside vendors, as defined by 411-054-0045(1) and (2).\n(f) Any and all additional documentation that supports the facility’s reasons for proposing a Less Than 30-day Move-out notice.\n(14) After receiving the facility’s documentation under (13) of this rule, the Department may request additional documentation from the facility concerning the proposed less than 30-day move-out, as deemed necessary by the Department. Such requested documentation may include, but is not limited to:\n(a) Documentation of attempts to resolve the reason for the requested move-out such as related progress notes, relevant Medication Administration Record(s), evaluations, clinical assessments, physician notes, and other documentation demonstrating the facility has attempted to staff resident’s temporary or intermittent needs, as required by OAR 411-054-0045(1)(f)(F).\n(b) Documentation that demonstrates the proposed move-out is consistent with the facility’s:\n(A) Uniform Disclosure Statement, as required by OAR 411-054-0026(1).\n(B) Residency Agreement, as required by OAR 411-054-0026(2).\n(C) Consumer Summary Statement, as required by OAR 411-054-0026(3).\n(c) Names and contact information concerning additional parties or witnesses, as appropriate, to allow the Department to obtain additional statements or evidence regarding the reason for the move.\n(15) After receiving all information required under (13) and requested under (14) of this rule, the Department will have two business days to review the involuntary move-out notice and any related documentation and provide the facility with written notice indicating whether or not the Department has determined the facility has provided documentation in compliance with these rules. If the Department determines sufficient documentation has not been provided, the Department will deny the move-out notice. A denial does not prohibit a facility from submitting or resubmitting a move-out notice that satisfies the criteria contained in (13) of this rule.\n(16) The Department will provide written notice to the facility with a determination regarding the proposed move-out. If the Department determines regulatory criteria were not met, the facility may not issue the move-out notice.\n(17) The facility may issue the notice if the Department has determined regulatory criteria has been met; the facility must submit the final version of form APD 0568 and form MSC 0443 to the Department, the resident, the resident's legal representative, the resident’s case manager, and the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman.\n(a) The Less Than 30-Day Move-Out and Hearing Notice (form APD 0568) must include notice of both the move-out and the rights to request a hearing (form MSC 0443). The completed form must contain both notices and be delivered to all required parties.\n(b) The facility must provide as much notice to the resident as possible but must always provide at least 24 hours.\n(c) The facility must email a copy of the Less Than 30-Day Move-Out and Hearing Notice form to the Department and to the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman on the same day the notice is delivered to the resident or the resident's legal representative.\n(d) The facility is responsible for providing a request for hearing from the resident or the resident’s legal representative, to the Department, within 24 hours of receiving it.\n(18) Administrative hearings requested under (17) will be conducted according to (19) of this rule.\n(19) INFORMAL CONFERENCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING. Except when a facility has had its license revoked, not renewed, voluntarily surrendered, or terminates its Medicaid contract, a resident who receives an involuntary move-out notice is entitled to an administrative hearing, provided the resident or resident's designee requests an administrative hearing in a timely manner.\n(a) A resident who receives a Move-Out and Hearing Notice can request a formal administrative hearing:\n(A) Residents have the following deadlines for requesting an administrative hearing after receipt of the notice:\n(i) Within ten (10) business days, for a 30-day notice.\n(ii) Within five (5) business days, for a less than 30-day notice.\n(B) If a resident wants to preserve the right to an administrative hearing, the resident, the resident’s legal representative, or the Long Term Care Ombudsman may check the appropriate box on the Move-Out and Hearing Notice (form APD 0567 and form MSC 0443), and return the notice to the facility. Residents may also exercise their administrative hearing rights by informing the facility, verbally or in writing, of the request for an administrative hearing.\n(C) If the resident or resident’s legal representative informs the facility of the request for a hearing, the facility must immediately notify the Department.\n(D) In cases involving a less than 30-day notice or where the resident is incapacitated and does not have a legal representative, the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman is allowed to provide notice to the Department on behalf of the resident, requesting an administrative hearing.\n(E) The resident, resident’s legal representative, the Long Term Care Ombudsman, or the facility may request the Department facilitate an informal conference before the administrative hearing, to discuss the move-out.\n(F) The Department may extend the time allowed requesting an informal conference or administrative hearing if the Department determines that good cause exists for failure to make a timely request.\n(G) The Department shall immediately notify the Office of Administrative Hearings of the request for a formal administrative hearing and, for a less than 30-day move-out, shall request an expedited hearing be held within 5 business days.\n(H) The Department may decide to hold an informal conference to resolve the matter without a formal administrative hearing. The Department shall notify all appropriate parties of the informal conference and shall facilitate the conference.\n(I) If the Department decides to hold an informal conference, the conference shall be scheduled to be held:\n(i) Within ten (10) business days of the Department receiving the request for hearing, for a 30 day move-out.\n(ii) Within four (4) business days of the Department receiving the request for hearing, for a less than 30-day move-out.\n(J) No formal administrative hearing shall be held if the resident is satisfied with the outcome of the informal conference.\n(b) The resident who has received a Less Than 30-Day Move-Out Notice will be allowed to continue to reside in the facility until the hearing process is completed unless substantial evidence is provided by the facility to the Department documenting that the change of behavior or medical condition of the resident creates a serious and immediate threat to the resident, other residents, or staff and all reasonable alternatives to move-out (consistent with the orders of the attending physician or primary care provider) have been attempted and documented in the resident’s medical record.\n(A) When a hearing has been requested, the Department shall request the Office of Administrative Hearings hold an expedited administrative hearing within five (5) business days.\n(B) When a hearing has been requested, but the resident has been moved out of the facility, the facility must hold the resident's room, without charge for room and board or services, pending resolution of the administrative hearing.

Consequently, publicly assisted rental housing affordable to low- and moderate-income persons and households should be preserved as a long-term resource to the maximum extent practicable, and the tenants of such properties should receive protections to facilitate securing new housing should the affordable units be converted to market rate units or otherwise be lost as a resource for low- and moderate-income housing.  Likewise, Portland renters in unregulated housing on the private market, need additional protections to ensure that there is adequate time to find alternative housing in the case of a no cause eviction and adequate time to budget for an increase in rent.", "state": "or", "city": "portland"}

Affordable housing. The term affordable housing, affordable rental housing or housing affordable to rental households means that the rent is structured so that the targeted tenant population pays no more than 30 percent of their gross household income for rent and utilities.  The targeted tenant populations referred to in this Section include households up to 80 percent of MFI.\nB. Associated housing costs include, but are not limited to, fees or utility or service charges, means the compensation or fees paid or charged, usually periodically, for the use of any property, land, buildings, or equipment. For purposes of this Chapter, housing costs include the basic rent charge and any periodic or monthly fees for other services paid to the landlord by the tenant, but do not include utility charges that are based on usage and that the tenant has agreed in the rental agreement to pay, unless the obligation to pay those charges is itself a change in the terms of the rental agreement.\nC. City subsidy.  Locally controlled public funds administered by Prosper Portland (which includes its predecessor, the Portland Development Commission), Portland Housing Bureau (PHB), or other City bureau or agency, allocated for the purpose of creating or preserving affordable rental housing to households below 80 percent of MFI.  City subsidies may be provided to developers through direct financial assistance such as low interest or deferred loans, grants, equity gap investments, credit enhancements or loan guarantees, or other mechanisms.\nD. City subsidy projects.  Privately-owned properties of five or more units that receive a City subsidy after the effective date of Title 30 through programs designed to create or preserve rental housing affordable at or below 80 percent of MFI.\nE. Commercial market compatible offer. A fair market value purchase offer made by the City or its designee that is consistent with the terms and conditions that would be made by a buyer on the open market such that a seller negotiating with the City on such terms would not experience any significant disadvantage as compared to a market rate transaction with a private party.\nF. Fair market value. The amount of money in cash that real property would bring in the open market if it were offered for sale by one who desired, but was not obligated to sell, and was bought by one willing but not obliged to buy.  It is the actual value of the property on the date when a City offer pursuant to Section 30.01.050 is made.  As may be further refined by the City Administrator through administrative rules developed in reference to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the Oregon Uniform Trial Instructions, and relevant case law, fair market value is based on the best and highest use of the property, which may be greater than the use being made of the property by the current owner.  However, fair market value does not include speculative value, possible value based on future expenditures and improvements, or potential changes in applicable zoning regulations or laws that are not reasonably probable.  fair market value includes assessment of environmental, structural or mechanical information derived from inspections or other due diligence activities.\nG. Federal preservation projects. Properties having project-based rental assistance contracts for some or all of the units (such as Section 8 and Project Rental Assistance Contracts) including those developed under a variety of HUD mortgage assistance and interest rate reduction programs.  Federal preservation projects include properties with loans, contracts, or insurance under the following federal subsidy programs: Section 221(d)(4) with project-based Section 8; Section 202; Section 236(J)(1); Section 221(D)(3) BMIR; Section 221(D)(3) MIR; Section 811; Project based Section 8 contracts administered through HUD, Oregon Housing and Community Services, or the Housing Authority of Portland; Project Rental Assistance Contracts (PRAC); LIHPRHA capital grant program; and Section 241(f) preservation grant.  An updated list of all known Federal Preservation Projects will be maintained and available upon request to the public.\nH. HUD.  The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\nI.  Involuntary displacement.  Tenants of Federal Preservation Projects are considered to be involuntarily displaced if:\n1.  They are served a notice to vacate the property for reasons other than Just Cause; or\n2.  They are not offered a one-year lease under their tenant-based voucher by the property owner; or\n3.  They are offered a one-year lease under their tenant-based voucher, but are required to pay as rent and utilities an amount greater than the tenant contribution to rent (and utilities) in effect under the project-based Section 8 contract, and they then choose to move from the property rather than enter into a lease under the voucher.  This form of displacement is referred to as “economic displacement.”\nJ.  Just cause.

In addition to the protections set forth in the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, the following additional protections apply to tenants that have a rental agreement for a dwelling unit covered by the Act. Terms not defined in this Chapter that are defined in the Act, have the meaning set forth in the Act\nB.  A Landlord may terminate a rental agreement without a cause or for a qualifying landlord reason specified in the Act only by delivering a written notice of termination (the “termination notice”) to the tenant of (a) not less than 90 days before the termination date designated in that notice as calculated under the Act; or (b) the time period designated in the rental agreement, whichever is longer. Not less than 45 days prior to the termination date provided in the termination notice, a landlord must pay to the tenant, as relocation assistance, a payment (“relocation assistance”) in the amount that follows: $2,900 for a studio or single room occupancy (SRO) Dwelling Unit, $3,300 for a one-bedroom dwelling unit, $4,200 for a two-bedroom dwelling unit and $4,500 for a three-bedroom or larger dwelling unit. For purposes of this Subsection, a landlord that declines to renew or replace an expiring rental agreement is subject to the provisions of this Subsection.  The requirements of this Subsection are intended to apply per dwelling unit, not per individual tenant. \nC.  As allowed by the Act, a landlord may not increase a tenant’s rent or associated housing costs by five percent or more over a rolling 12-month period unless the landlord gives notice in writing (the “Increase Notice”) to each affected tenant: (a) at least 90 days prior to the effective date of the rent increase; or (b) the time period designated in the Rental Agreement, whichever is longer. The increase notice must specify the amount of the increase, the amount of the new rent or associated housing costs and the date, as calculated under the Act, when the increase becomes effective.  If, within 45 calendar days after a tenant receives an increase notice indicating a rent increase of 10 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period and a tenant provides written notice to the landlord of the tenant’s request for relocation assistance (the “tenant’s notice”), then, within 31 calendar days of receiving the tenant’s notice, the landlord must pay to the tenant relocation assistance in the amount that follows:  $2,900 for a studio or SRO dwelling unit, $3,300 for a one-bedroom dwelling unit, $4,200 for a two-bedroom dwelling unit and $4,500 for a three-bedroom or larger dwelling unit.  After the tenant receives the relocation assistance from the landlord, the tenant will have six months from the effective date of the rent increase (the “relocation period”) to either: (i) pay back the relocation assistance and remain in the dwelling unit and, subject to the Act, will be obligated to pay the increased rent in accordance with the increase notice for the duration of the tenant’s occupancy of the dwelling unit; or (ii) provide the landlord with a notice to terminate the rental agreement in accordance with the Act (the “tenant’s termination notice”).  In the event that the tenant has not repaid the relocation assistance to the landlord or provided the landlord with the tenant’s termination notice on or before the expiration of the relocation period, the tenant will be in violation of this Subsection. For purposes of this Subsection, a landlord that conditions the renewal or replacement of an expiring rental agreement on the tenant’s agreement to pay a rent increase of 10 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period is subject to the provisions of this Subsection.  For purposes of this Subsection, a landlord that declines to renew or replace an expiring rental agreement on substantially the same terms except for the amount of rent or associated housing costs terminates the rental agreement and is subject to the provisions of this Subsection.  The requirements of this Subsection are intended to apply per dwelling unit, not per individual tenant. For purposes of this Subsection, a tenant may only receive and retain relocation assistance once per tenancy per dwelling unit.\nD.  A landlord must include a description of a tenant’s rights and obligations and the eligible amount of relocation assistance under this Section 30.01.085 with each and any termination notice, increase notice, and relocation assistance payment.\nE.  A landlord must provide notice to PHB of all payments to tenants of relocation assistance within 30 days of making such payments. \nF.  For the purposes of this Section 30.01.085, the expiration of rent concessions specified in the rental agreement is not considered a substantial change to a rental agreement.\nG.  For the purposes of this Section 30.01.085 and determining the amount of relocation assistance a landlord must pay, a rental agreement for a single bedroom in a dwelling unit as defined by Portland City Code Chapter 33.910 is considered a SRO dwelling unit.\nH.  For the purposes of this Section 30.01.085 and determining the amount of relocation assistance a landlord must pay, if a landlord is paying relocation assistance required by the Act and relocation assistance required by Section 30.01.085 to the tenant for the same termination notice, the relocation assistance required by Section 30.01.085 may be reduced by the relocation assistance required by the Act if both payments are paid at the same time and as a single payment.\nI.  The provisions of this Section 30.01.085 that pertain to relocation assistance do not apply to the following so long as the landlord has submitted a required exemption application form to PHB for which PHB has issued an exemption acknowledgement letter, a copy of which the landlord  has given the tenant:\n1.  Rental agreements for week-to-week tenancies;\n2.  Tenants that occupy the same dwelling unit as the Landlord;\n3.  Tenants that occupy one dwelling unit in a duplex where the Landlord’s principal residence is the second dwelling unit in the same duplex;\n4.  Tenants that occupy an accessory dwelling unit that is subject to the Act so long as the owner of the accessory dwelling Unit lives on the site, or tenancies where the owner occupies the accessory dwelling Unit and the tenant occupies a dwelling unit on the site;\n5.  A landlord that temporarily rents out the landlord’s principal residence during the landlord’s absence of not more than three years;\n6.  A landlord that temporarily rents out the landlord’s principal residence during the landlord’s absence due to active duty military service;\n7.  A dwelling unit where the landlord is terminating the rental agreement in order for an immediate family member to occupy the dwelling unit;\n8.  A dwelling unit regulated or certified as affordable housing by a federal, state or local government is exempt from paying relocation assistance for a rent increase of 10 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period:\na.  So long as such increase does not increase a tenant’s portion of the rent payment by 10 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period; or\nb.  In lease agreements where the rent or eligibility is periodically calculated based on the tenant’s income or other program eligibility requirements and a rent increase is necessary due to program eligibility requirements or a change in the tenant’s income.\nc.  This exemption by Subsection 30.01.085 I.8. does not apply to private market-rate dwelling units with a tenant who is the recipient of a federal, state, or local government voucher;\nd.  This exemption by Subsection 30.01.085 I.8. applies to rent increases and does not apply to termination notices;\n9.  A dwelling unit that is subject to and in compliance with the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970;\n10.  A dwelling unit rendered immediately uninhabitable not due to the action or inaction of a landlord or tenant;\n11.  A dwelling unit rented for less than six months with appropriate verification of the submission of a demolition permit prior to the tenant renting the dwelling unit;\n12.  A dwelling unit where the landlord has provided a fixed-term tenancy and notified the tenant prior to occupancy, of the landlord’s intent to sell or permanently convert the dwelling unit to a use other than as a dwelling unit subject to the Act.\nJ.  A Landlord that authorizes a property manager that is subject to, and manages property in accordance with ORS 696, to manage a dwelling unit, does not waive a dwelling unit exemption as a result of the collective number of dwelling units managed by such a property manager. For purposes of the exemptions provided in this Section, “dwelling unit” is defined by Portland City Code Chapter 33.910, and not by ORS 90.100. For purposes of the exemptions provided in this Section, “accessory dwelling unit” is defined by Portland City Code Chapter 33.205. For purposes of the exemptions provided in this Section, “duplex” is defined by Portland City Code Chapter 33.910.  For purposes of the exemptions provided in this Section, “immediate family” is defined in administrative rules.\nK.  A Landlord that fails to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Section 30.01.085 is  liable to the tenant for an amount up to three times the monthly rent as well as actual damages, relocation assistance, reasonable attorney fees and costs (collectively, “damages”). Any tenant claiming to be aggrieved by a landlord’s noncompliance with the foregoing has a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages and such other remedies as may be appropriate. \nL.  The City Administrator may take any actions necessary to implement this Section, including but not limited to defining terms and preparing forms; establishing timeframes, standards, policies, and procedures controlling the application, issuance, use, and expiration of notices and acknowledgment letters; imposing notice and eligibility requirements; establishing time requirements by which landlords must apply for and issue acknowledgment letters and notices to tenants; developing standards and criteria for evaluating the applicability of exemptions; approving or denying applications for acknowledgment letters, in accordance with established standards and criteria; regulating the applicability and use of exemptions as the City Administrator determines is appropriate; and, adopting other requirements the City Administrator determines are necessary to ensure compliance with this Code Section.", "state": "or", "city": "portland"}

The landlord may not require an applicant’s guarantor agreement to exceed the term of the rental agreement.\n3.  Evaluating adult tenants who are not applicants.  A landlord may screen an adult non-applicant tenant who will reside with an applicant in a dwelling unit but who is not responsible for paying the rent, only for factors related to maintaining the property, and for conduct consistent with the health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or the landlord and to evaluate prospective tenants’ ability to comply with the landlord’s rules of residency.  A landlord may not screen a non-applicant tenant for financial responsibility.\n4.  Application denial generally.\na.  A landlord may deny any applicant or non-applicant tenant in accordance with the requirements of Section 30.01.086 and all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\nb.  If an applicant qualifies for a dwelling unit, the landlord may not deny that applicant based on the denial of a non-applicant tenant that the applicant included on the application. Instead, the landlord must allow the qualifying applicant to accept the dwelling unit without the non-applicant tenant.\nc.  An applicant’s request for reasonable modification or accommodation for a disability, or the nature of the modification or accommodation requested, may not be a factor for a landlord’s denial of an applicant.\n5.  Communication of determination.  Within two weeks after a landlord or its screening company completes its evaluation of an applicant, the landlord must provide applicant with a written communication of acceptance, conditional acceptance, or denial and in the case of a conditional acceptance or denial, describe the basis for the decision.\n6.  Disability related modification requests.\na.  An applicant with a disability that is otherwise approved through the screening process and requests a modification may not be denied housing based solely on a landlord’s denial of a requested modification.\nb.  If a landlord denies an applicant’s modification request, the landlord must provide the applicant two successive 24-hour periods within which to request alternative modifications.\nc.  If no reasonable modification can be made to the dwelling unit to address the applicant’s disability, the applicant, if otherwise eligible, may accept the dwelling unit without modification.\n7.

A term not defined in this Chapter that is defined in the Act has the meaning set forth in the Act.\nA. Amount of security deposit.\n1. If a landlord requires, as a condition of tenancy, a security deposit that includes last month’s rent, a landlord may not collect as an additional part of the security deposit more than an amount equal to one-half of one month’s rent. \n2. If a landlord does not require last month’s rent, a landlord may not collect more than an amount equal to one month’s rent as a security deposit.\n3. If a landlord conditionally approves an application subject to an applicant’s demonstration of financial capacity or to offset risk factors identified by the applicant screening for tenancy as described in Section 30.01.086, the landlord may require payment of an amount equal to one-half of one month’s rent as a security deposit in addition to the other amounts authorized in this Subsection.  The landlord must allow a tenant to pay any such additional security deposit in installments over a period of up to three months in installment amounts reasonably requested by the tenant.\nB. Bank deposit of tenant funds.\n1. Within two weeks following receipt of a tenant’s funds paid as a security deposit or for last-month’s rent, a landlord must deposit all of such funds into a secure financial institution account segregated from the landlord’s personal and business operating accounts.  If the account is an interest-bearing account, all interest will accrue proportionately to the benefit of the tenant and must be returned to the tenant with the unused security deposit in accordance with Subsection B.2. below.  If the account bears interest, the landlord is required to pay such interest in full, minus an optional five percent deduction for administrative costs from such interest, to the tenant unless it is used to cover any claims for damage. For interest bearing accounts, the landlord must provide a receipt of the account and any interest earned at the tenant’s request, no more than once per year.  The rental agreement must reflect the name and address of the financial institution at which the security deposit is deposited and whether the security deposit is held in an interest-bearing account.\n2. A landlord must provide a written accounting and refund in accordance with ORS 90.300.\nC. Amounts withheld for repair.\n1. A landlord may only apply security deposit funds for the repair and replacement of those fixtures, appliances, equipment or personal property that are identified in the rental agreement.\n2. A landlord may claim from the security deposit amounts equal only to the costs reasonably necessary to repair the premises to its condition existing at the commencement of the rental agreement (commencement date); provided however, that a landlord may not claim any portion of the security deposit for routine maintenance; for ordinary wear and tear; for replacement of fixtures, appliances, equipment, or personal property that failed or sustained damage due to causes other than the tenant’s acts or omissions; or for any cost that is reimbursed by a landlord’s property or comprehensive general liability insurance or by a warranty.\n3. Any landlord-provided fixtures, appliances, equipment, or personal property, the condition of which a landlord plans to be covered by the tenant security deposit, must be itemized by description and incorporated into the rental agreement.\n4. A landlord may apply the tenant security deposit to the cost of repair or replacement of flooring material only if repair or replacement is necessitated by use in excess of ordinary wear and tear and is limited to the costs of repair or replacement of the discrete impacted area and not for the other areas of the dwelling unit. A discrete impacted area is defined as the general area of the dwelling unit where the repair or replacement is needed, which may include an entire room, closet, hallway, stairway, or other defined space, but not beyond.\n5. A landlord may not apply the tenant security deposit to the costs of interior painting of the leased premises, except to repair specific damage caused by the tenant in excess of ordinary wear and tear, or to repaint walls that were painted by the tenant without permission.\nD. Condition reports.\n1. Preparing and updating the condition report and condition report addendum.\na. Prior to the commencement date, the landlord must make reasonable efforts to schedule a time that is convenient for both the landlord and the tenant for a walk through of the unit to complete a report noting the condition of all fixtures, appliances, equipment and personal property listed in the rental agreement and noting damage (the condition report). Both the tenant and the landlord must sign the condition report. The landlord must take pictures of the items noted in the condition report and share those photographs with the tenant.\nb. Should the landlord and tenant be unable to schedule a mutually convenient time to walk through the unit to complete the condition report, the landlord must complete the condition report prior the commencement date. The landlord must take pictures of the items noted in the condition report and share those photographs with the tenant on the commencement date.\nc. Within seven days following the commencement date, the tenant may complete and submit to the landlord a condition report addendum on a form provided by the landlord. If the tenant does not complete and submit a condition report addendum to the landlord within seven days of the commencement date, then the landlord’s condition report becomes final. \nd. If the tenant submits a condition report addendum, the Landlord has seven days to dispute the condition report addendum in writing. If the landlord fails to timely dispute the condition report Addendum, then the condition report, as modified by the condition report addendum, must establish the baseline condition of the dwelling unit as of the commencement date against which the landlord will be required to assess any dwelling unit repair or replacement needs identified in a final inspection (defined below) that will result in costs that may be deducted from the tenant security deposit as of termination of the rental agreement (the termination date).\ne. If the landlord disputes the condition report addendum, and the landlord and tenant are unable to resolve the dispute as to the condition of the dwelling unit at the commencement date, the condition report and condition report addendum must be retained by the landlord. Any unresolved dispute as to the condition of the dwelling unit as of the commencement date will be resolved, if necessary, in any court of competent jurisdiction. \nf. The landlord must update the condition report to reflect all repairs and replacements impacting the dwelling unit during the term of the rental agreement and must provide the updated condition report to the tenant, and the tenant may complete or update the condition report addendum to reflect all repairs and replacements.\n2. Within one week following the termination date a landlord must conduct a walk-through of the dwelling unit at the tenant’s option, with the tenant or tenant’s representative, to document any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear not noted on the condition report (the “final inspection”).  The tenant, or the tenant’s representative, may choose to be present for the final inspection.  The landlord must give notice of the date and time of the final inspection at least 24 hours in advance to the tenant.\n3. A landlord must prepare an itemization describing any repair and replacement in accordance with the fixture, appliances, equipment, or personal property identified in the rental agreement.  The landlord must document any visual damage in excess of normal wear and tear with photographs that the landlord must provide to the tenant with a written accounting in accordance with ORS 90.300 (12).  To the extent that a landlord seeks to charge labor costs greater than $200 to a tenant, the landlord must provide documentation demonstrating that the labor costs are reasonable and consistent with the typical hourly rates in the metropolitan region.  A landlord may not charge for the repair of any damage or replacement of malfunctioning or damaged appliances, fixtures, equipment, or personal property noted on the condition report.\nE. Notice of rights.  Contemporaneously with the delivery of the written accounting required by ORS 90.300(12), a landlord must also deliver to the tenant a written notice of rights regarding security deposits (notice of rights).  The notice of rights must specify all tenant’s right to damages under this Section.  The requirement in this Subsection may be met by delivering a copy of this Section to the tenant and contact information for the nearest Legal Aid Services of Oregon, or online and physical address of the Oregon State Bar.\nF. Rent payment history.  Within five business days of receiving a request from a tenant or delivering a notice of intent to terminate a tenancy, a landlord must provide a written accounting to the tenant of the tenant’s rent payment history that covers up to the prior two years of tenancy, as well as a fully completed rental history form available on the Portland Housing Bureau website.  The landlord must also provide the tenant with an accounting of the security deposit as soon as practicable but no later than within the timeframes prescribed by ORS 90.300.\nG. Damages.  A landlord that fails to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Section is liable to the tenant for an amount up to $250 per violation plus actual damages, reasonable attorney fees and costs (collectively, “damages”).
