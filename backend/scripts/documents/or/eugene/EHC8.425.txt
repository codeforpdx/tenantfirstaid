The additional security deposit authorized by this subparagraph (b) may not exceed an amount equal to one month’s rent for the dwelling unit.
(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) of this subsection (15), a landlord may require an additional security deposit if the landlord enters into a rental agreement with a tenant whose rental housing application the landlord could have denied pursuant to ORS 90.304.

(16) Applications Processed in Order Received. 
(a) If a landlord advertises the availability of a dwelling unit, the landlord must specify in the notice advertising the dwelling unit the date and time that the landlord will begin accepting rental applications as well as the open application period. The notice advertising the dwelling unit must also inform applicants of the ability to request additional time to ensure that applicants have meaningful access to the rental housing application.

If a rental housing application is received by a landlord prior to the start of the open application period, the landlord must digitally or manually record the date and time of receipt of that application as 8 hours after the start of the open application period.
(c) A landlord may simultaneously process multiple rental housing applications, but must accept, conditionally accept, or deny rental housing applications in order of receipt.

(e) When a landlord utilizes a waitlist to fill a dwelling unit vacancy, a landlord may simultaneously process multiple rental housing applications but must accept, conditionally accept, or deny rental housing applications in order of receipt.
(f) If an applicant requires additional time to ensure meaningful access to a rental housing application, the applicant may submit a request for additional time to the landlord. The landlord must document the date and time of the landlord’s receipt of the request for additional time. If the applicant submits a rental housing application within 24 hours from the time of submission of a request for additional time, the date and time of the request for additional time will serve as the date and time of receipt of the rental housing application for purposes of determining the order in which applications are received.
(g) Upon request by an applicant, a landlord must notify the applicant of the applicant’s position in line for a particular dwelling unit.
(h) A landlord must offer tenancy to the first qualified applicant who provides a rental housing application. If that applicant does not accept the offer of tenancy within 48 hours of the time the offer is made, the landlord must review the rental housing applications in order of receipt and make an offer of tenancy to the next qualified applicant who provided a rental housing application. The landlord must repeat this process until an applicant accepts the offer of tenancy.
