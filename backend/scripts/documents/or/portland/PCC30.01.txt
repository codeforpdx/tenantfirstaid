30.01.010 Policy.
(Amended by Ordinances 187380 and 191973, effective January 1, 2025.) 

It is the policy of the City that all Portlanders, regardless of income level, family composition, race, ethnicity, or physical ability, have reasonable certainty in their housing, whether publicly assisted or on the private market. Consequently, publicly assisted rental housing affordable to low- and moderate-income persons and households should be preserved as a long-term resource to the maximum extent practicable, and the tenants of such properties should receive protections to facilitate securing new housing should the affordable units be converted to market rate units or otherwise be lost as a resource for low- and moderate-income housing.  Likewise, Portland renters in unregulated housing on the private market, need additional protections to ensure that there is adequate time to find alternative housing in the case of a no cause eviction and adequate time to budget for an increase in rent.
30.01.020 Intent.
(Amended by Ordinances 187380 and 191973, effective January 1, 2025.)

The intent of this Title is to protect the availability of publicly assisted affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households by: providing for notice to the City and tenants when transitions from current assistance programs and/or affordable housing uses are planned; providing purchase opportunities for the City to attempt to preserve the affordable housing while respecting ownership interests of building owners; providing tenant relocation assistance when the affordable housing is converted; and, ensuring long term affordability in future projects that the City assists with public financing designed to create or preserve affordable housing; and ensuring that all Portland renters have additional protections to ensure more certainty in their housing security.
30.01.030 Definitions.
(Amended by Ordinances 186028, 187380, 188163, 189323, 190381, and 191973, effective January 1, 2025.)

A. Affordable housing. The term affordable housing, affordable rental housing or housing affordable to rental households means that the rent is structured so that the targeted tenant population pays no more than 30 percent of their gross household income for rent and utilities.  The targeted tenant populations referred to in this Section include households up to 80 percent of MFI.
B. Associated housing costs include, but are not limited to, fees or utility or service charges, means the compensation or fees paid or charged, usually periodically, for the use of any property, land, buildings, or equipment. For purposes of this Chapter, housing costs include the basic rent charge and any periodic or monthly fees for other services paid to the landlord by the tenant, but do not include utility charges that are based on usage and that the tenant has agreed in the rental agreement to pay, unless the obligation to pay those charges is itself a change in the terms of the rental agreement.
C. City subsidy.  Locally controlled public funds administered by Prosper Portland (which includes its predecessor, the Portland Development Commission), Portland Housing Bureau (PHB), or other City bureau or agency, allocated for the purpose of creating or preserving affordable rental housing to households below 80 percent of MFI.  City subsidies may be provided to developers through direct financial assistance such as low interest or deferred loans, grants, equity gap investments, credit enhancements or loan guarantees, or other mechanisms.
D. City subsidy projects.  Privately-owned properties of five or more units that receive a City subsidy after the effective date of Title 30 through programs designed to create or preserve rental housing affordable at or below 80 percent of MFI.
E. Commercial market compatible offer. A fair market value purchase offer made by the City or its designee that is consistent with the terms and conditions that would be made by a buyer on the open market such that a seller negotiating with the City on such terms would not experience any significant disadvantage as compared to a market rate transaction with a private party.
F. Fair market value. The amount of money in cash that real property would bring in the open market if it were offered for sale by one who desired, but was not obligated to sell, and was bought by one willing but not obliged to buy.  It is the actual value of the property on the date when a City offer pursuant to Section 30.01.050 is made.  As may be further refined by the City Administrator through administrative rules developed in reference to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, the Oregon Uniform Trial Instructions, and relevant case law, fair market value is based on the best and highest use of the property, which may be greater than the use being made of the property by the current owner.  However, fair market value does not include speculative value, possible value based on future expenditures and improvements, or potential changes in applicable zoning regulations or laws that are not reasonably probable.  fair market value includes assessment of environmental, structural or mechanical information derived from inspections or other due diligence activities.
G. Federal preservation projects. Properties having project-based rental assistance contracts for some or all of the units (such as Section 8 and Project Rental Assistance Contracts) including those developed under a variety of HUD mortgage assistance and interest rate reduction programs.  Federal preservation projects include properties with loans, contracts, or insurance under the following federal subsidy programs: Section 221(d)(4) with project-based Section 8; Section 202; Section 236(J)(1); Section 221(D)(3) BMIR; Section 221(D)(3) MIR; Section 811; Project based Section 8 contracts administered through HUD, Oregon Housing and Community Services, or the Housing Authority of Portland; Project Rental Assistance Contracts (PRAC); LIHPRHA capital grant program; and Section 241(f) preservation grant.

3.  They are offered a one-year lease under their tenant-based voucher, but are required to pay as rent and utilities an amount greater than the tenant contribution to rent (and utilities) in effect under the project-based Section 8 contract, and they then choose to move from the property rather than enter into a lease under the voucher.  This form of displacement is referred to as “economic displacement.”
J.  Just cause.  Serious or repeated violations of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause.
K.  Local preservation projects.  Properties with 10 or more rental units that received financial assistance (from the programs listed below), to create or preserve housing serving households below 80 percent of MFI since January 1, 1988, and through the effective date of Title 30, that have affordability restrictions that are still in force as of the effective date of Title 30.  Financial assistance programs include subsidies from the City through the Portland Development Commission (Rental Housing Development Loan Program, Investor Rehabilitation Loan Program, Rental Rehabilitation Loan Program, or Downtown Housing Preservation Program) and from the Oregon Housing and Community Services Department (Housing Development Grant Program, Oregon Affordable Housing Tax Credit Program, and the former Oregon Lenders Tax Credit Program, Risk Sharing Bond program, Elderly and Disabled Bond Program).

30.01.085 Portland Renter Additional Protections.
(Added by Ordinance 187380; amended by Ordinances 188219, 188519, 188558, 188628, 188849, 189421, 189726, 190625, and 191973, effective January 1, 2025.)

A.  In addition to the protections set forth in the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, the following additional protections apply to tenants that have a rental agreement for a dwelling unit covered by the Act. Terms not defined in this Chapter that are defined in the Act, have the meaning set forth in the Act
B.  A Landlord may terminate a rental agreement without a cause or for a qualifying landlord reason specified in the Act only by delivering a written notice of termination (the “termination notice”) to the tenant of (a) not less than 90 days before the termination date designated in that notice as calculated under the Act; or (b) the time period designated in the rental agreement, whichever is longer. Not less than 45 days prior to the termination date provided in the termination notice, a landlord must pay to the tenant, as relocation assistance, a payment (“relocation assistance”) in the amount that follows: $2,900 for a studio or single room occupancy (SRO) Dwelling Unit, $3,300 for a one-bedroom dwelling unit, $4,200 for a two-bedroom dwelling unit and $4,500 for a three-bedroom or larger dwelling unit. For purposes of this Subsection, a landlord that declines to renew or replace an expiring rental agreement is subject to the provisions of this Subsection.  The requirements of this Subsection are intended to apply per dwelling unit, not per individual tenant. 
C.  As allowed by the Act, a landlord may not increase a tenant’s rent or associated housing costs by five percent or more over a rolling 12-month period unless the landlord gives notice in writing (the “Increase Notice”) to each affected tenant: (a) at least 90 days prior to the effective date of the rent increase; or (b) the time period designated in the Rental Agreement, whichever is longer. The increase notice must specify the amount of the increase, the amount of the new rent or associated housing costs and the date, as calculated under the Act, when the increase becomes effective.  If, within 45 calendar days after a tenant receives an increase notice indicating a rent increase of 10 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period and a tenant provides written notice to the landlord of the tenant’s request for relocation assistance (the “tenant’s notice”), then, within 31 calendar days of receiving the tenant’s notice, the landlord must pay to the tenant relocation assistance in the amount that follows:  $2,900 for a studio or SRO dwelling unit, $3,300 for a one-bedroom dwelling unit, $4,200 for a two-bedroom dwelling unit and $4,500 for a three-bedroom or larger dwelling unit.  After the tenant receives the relocation assistance from the landlord, the tenant will have six months from the effective date of the rent increase (the “relocation period”) to either: (i) pay back the relocation assistance and remain in the dwelling unit and, subject to the Act, will be obligated to pay the increased rent in accordance with the increase notice for the duration of the tenant’s occupancy of the dwelling unit; or (ii) provide the landlord with a notice to terminate the rental agreement in accordance with the Act (the “tenant’s termination notice”).  In the event that the tenant has not repaid the relocation assistance to the landlord or provided the landlord with the tenant’s termination notice on or before the expiration of the relocation period, the tenant will be in violation of this Subsection. For purposes of this Subsection, a landlord that conditions the renewal or replacement of an expiring rental agreement on the tenant’s agreement to pay a rent increase of 10 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period is subject to the provisions of this Subsection.  For purposes of this Subsection, a landlord that declines to renew or replace an expiring rental agreement on substantially the same terms except for the amount of rent or associated housing costs terminates the rental agreement and is subject to the provisions of this Subsection.  The requirements of this Subsection are intended to apply per dwelling unit, not per individual tenant. For purposes of this Subsection, a tenant may only receive and retain relocation assistance once per tenancy per dwelling unit.
D.  A landlord must include a description of a tenant’s rights and obligations and the eligible amount of relocation assistance under this Section 30.01.085 with each and any termination notice, increase notice, and relocation assistance payment.
E.  A landlord must provide notice to PHB of all payments to tenants of relocation assistance within 30 days of making such payments. 
F.  For the purposes of this Section 30.01.085, the expiration of rent concessions specified in the rental agreement is not considered a substantial change to a rental agreement.
G.  For the purposes of this Section 30.01.085 and determining the amount of relocation assistance a landlord must pay, a rental agreement for a single bedroom in a dwelling unit as defined by Portland City Code Chapter 33.910 is considered a SRO dwelling unit.
H.  For the purposes of this Section 30.01.085 and determining the amount of relocation assistance a landlord must pay, if a landlord is paying relocation assistance required by the Act and relocation assistance required by Section 30.01.085 to the tenant for the same termination notice, the relocation assistance required by Section 30.01.085 may be reduced by the relocation assistance required by the Act if both payments are paid at the same time and as a single payment.
I.  The provisions of this Section 30.01.085 that pertain to relocation assistance do not apply to the following so long as the landlord has submitted a required exemption application form to PHB for which PHB has issued an exemption acknowledgement letter, a copy of which the landlord  has given the tenant:
1.  Rental agreements for week-to-week tenancies;
2.  Tenants that occupy the same dwelling unit as the Landlord;
3.  Tenants that occupy one dwelling unit in a duplex where the Landlord’s principal residence is the second dwelling unit in the same duplex;
4.  Tenants that occupy an accessory dwelling unit that is subject to the Act so long as the owner of the accessory dwelling Unit lives on the site, or tenancies where the owner occupies the accessory dwelling Unit and the tenant occupies a dwelling unit on the site;
5.  A landlord that temporarily rents out the landlord’s principal residence during the landlord’s absence of not more than three years;
6.  A landlord that temporarily rents out the landlord’s principal residence during the landlord’s absence due to active duty military service;
7.  A dwelling unit where the landlord is terminating the rental agreement in order for an immediate family member to occupy the dwelling unit;
8.  A dwelling unit regulated or certified as affordable housing by a federal, state or local government is exempt from paying relocation assistance for a rent increase of 10 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period:
a.  So long as such increase does not increase a tenant’s portion of the rent payment by 10 percent or more within a rolling 12-month period; or
b.  In lease agreements where the rent or eligibility is periodically calculated based on the tenant’s income or other program eligibility requirements and a rent increase is necessary due to program eligibility requirements or a change in the tenant’s income.
c.  This exemption by Subsection 30.01.085 I.8. does not apply to private market-rate dwelling units with a tenant who is the recipient of a federal, state, or local government voucher;
d.  This exemption by Subsection 30.01.085 I.8. applies to rent increases and does not apply to termination notices;
9.  A dwelling unit that is subject to and in compliance with the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970;
10.  A dwelling unit rendered immediately uninhabitable not due to the action or inaction of a landlord or tenant;
11.  A dwelling unit rented for less than six months with appropriate verification of the submission of a demolition permit prior to the tenant renting the dwelling unit;
12.  A dwelling unit where the landlord has provided a fixed-term tenancy and notified the tenant prior to occupancy, of the landlord’s intent to sell or permanently convert the dwelling unit to a use other than as a dwelling unit subject to the Act.
J.  A Landlord that authorizes a property manager that is subject to, and manages property in accordance with ORS 696, to manage a dwelling unit, does not waive a dwelling unit exemption as a result of the collective number of dwelling units managed by such a property manager. For purposes of the exemptions provided in this Section, “dwelling unit” is defined by Portland City Code Chapter 33.910, and not by ORS 90.100. For purposes of the exemptions provided in this Section, “accessory dwelling unit” is defined by Portland City Code Chapter 33.205. For purposes of the exemptions provided in this Section, “duplex” is defined by Portland City Code Chapter 33.910.  For purposes of the exemptions provided in this Section, “immediate family” is defined in administrative rules.
K.  A Landlord that fails to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Section 30.01.085 is  liable to the tenant for an amount up to three times the monthly rent as well as actual damages, relocation assistance, reasonable attorney fees and costs (collectively, “damages”). Any tenant claiming to be aggrieved by a landlord’s noncompliance with the foregoing has a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages and such other remedies as may be appropriate. 
L.  The City Administrator may take any actions necessary to implement this Section, including but not limited to defining terms and preparing forms; establishing timeframes, standards, policies, and procedures controlling the application, issuance, use, and expiration of notices and acknowledgment letters; imposing notice and eligibility requirements; establishing time requirements by which landlords must apply for and issue acknowledgment letters and notices to tenants; developing standards and criteria for evaluating the applicability of exemptions; approving or denying applications for acknowledgment letters, in accordance with established standards and criteria; regulating the applicability and use of exemptions as the City Administrator determines is appropriate; and, adopting other requirements the City Administrator determines are necessary to ensure compliance with this Code Section.

(2)  When members of a waitlist apply for a vacancy, a landlord may simultaneously process multiple applications but must accept, conditionally accept, or deny applicants in order of receipt of a completed application.
c.  Applications for accessible dwelling units.
(1)  When, during the first eight hours of the open application period, a landlord receives an application for an accessible dwelling unit from an applicant with a household member that is mobility disabled, the landlord must give priority to such application and accept, conditionally accept, or deny the applicant prior to considering other applicants.
(2)  If there are multiple applicants for an accessible dwelling unit with a household member that is mobility disabled, the landlord must accept, conditionally accept, or deny such applications in order of receipt, but prior to processing completed applications for any applicants without household members that are mobility disabled.
d.  The requirements of this Subsection C. do not apply to applications for dwelling units regulated as affordable housing by a federal, state, or local government for households that earn no more than 80 percent of the median household income and are leased through a lottery or preference process, or through the Multnomah County Coordinated Access System.
e.  Upon a landlord’s approval and the applicant’s acceptance of the dwelling unit, the applicant and the landlord must enter into a rental agreement.  The landlord may require all adult tenants or persons intending to occupy the dwelling unit to sign rules of residency.

d.  If the landlord charges a screening fee, a description of the landlord’s screening criteria and evaluation process; and
e.  An opportunity for applicant to include supplemental evidence for the landlord’s consideration to mitigate potentially negative screening results.
D.  General screening process.  Landlords must apply the general screening process described in this Subsection D. but may screen applicants using additional screening criteria.  If applying additional screening criteria, the landlord must: 1) use a screening criteria no more prohibitive to the tenant than the low-barrier criteria described in Subsection E.; or 2) use a screening criteria of the landlord’s choosing (landlord’s screening criteria);  however, when using the landlord’s screening criteria, a landlord must conduct an individual assessment in accordance with the requirements of Subsection F., before denying an applicant.
A landlord must comply with the following general screening process:
1.  Applicant identification.  A landlord may not reject an application as incomplete because an applicant or member of the applicant’s household does not produce a Social Security number or prove lawful presence in the U.S.  A landlord may not inquire about the immigration status of a member of the Applicant’s household or require proof of their lawful presence in the U.S.  A Landlord must accept any of the following, or a combination thereof, to verify the name, date of birth and photo of the applicant:

c.  Immigrant visa;
d.  Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN);
e.  Nonimmigrant visa;
f.  Any government-issued identification regardless of expiration date; or
g.  Any nongovernmental identification or combination of identifications that would permit a reasonable verification of identity.
2.  Financial responsibility of applicant.  When multiple persons will reside in common within a dwelling unit, the persons may choose which adults will be the applicants financially responsible for the dwelling unit and which will be the tenants with no financial responsibility (non-applicant tenant).  The landlord may screen only an applicant for financial responsibility, and not a non-applicant tenant
a.  A landlord may require an applicant to demonstrate a monthly gross income of up to but not greater than 2.5 times the amount of the rent for the dwelling unit when the monthly rent amount is below the maximum monthly rent for a household earning no more than 80 percent of the median household income as published annually by the Portland Housing Bureau.
b.  A landlord may require an applicant to demonstrate a monthly gross income of up to, but not greater than two times the amount of the rent for the dwelling unit when the monthly rent amount is at or above the maximum monthly rent for a household earning no more than 80 percent of the median household income as published annually by the Portland Housing Bureau.
c.  For the purposes of this Subsection, a landlord’s evaluation of an applicant’s income to rent ratio must:
(1)  Include all income sources of an applicant, including, but not limited to, wages, rent assistance (nongovernmental only), and monetary public benefits. The landlord may also choose to consider verifiable friend or family assistance;
(2)  Calculate based on a rental amount that is reduced by the amount of any local, state, or federal government rent voucher or housing subsidy available to the applicant; and
(3)  Be based on the cumulative financial resources of all applicants.
d.  If an applicant does not meet the minimum income ratios as described in Subsections 30.01.086 D.2.a. and 2.b., a landlord may require additional and documented security from a guarantor, or in the form of an additional security deposit pursuant to Subsection 30.01.087 A.  The landlord must communicate this conditional approval to the applicant in writing and indicate the amount of the additional security.  Applicant will have no less than 48 hours after the communication of conditional approval to accept or decline this opportunity.
e.  If a landlord chooses to require additional documented security from a guarantor, the landlord may require the guarantor to demonstrate financial capacity. If the guarantor is a friend or family member, the landlord cannot require the guarantor to have income greater than three times the rent amount.  The landlord may not require an applicant’s guarantor agreement to exceed the term of the rental agreement.
3.  Evaluating adult tenants who are not applicants.  A landlord may screen an adult non-applicant tenant who will reside with an applicant in a dwelling unit but who is not responsible for paying the rent, only for factors related to maintaining the property, and for conduct consistent with the health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or the landlord and to evaluate prospective tenants’ ability to comply with the landlord’s rules of residency.  A landlord may not screen a non-applicant tenant for financial responsibility.
4.  Application denial generally.
a.  A landlord may deny any applicant or non-applicant tenant in accordance with the requirements of Section 30.01.086 and all applicable federal, state, and local laws.
b.  If an applicant qualifies for a dwelling unit, the landlord may not deny that applicant based on the denial of a non-applicant tenant that the applicant included on the application. Instead, the landlord must allow the qualifying applicant to accept the dwelling unit without the non-applicant tenant.
c.  An applicant’s request for reasonable modification or accommodation for a disability, or the nature of the modification or accommodation requested, may not be a factor for a landlord’s denial of an applicant.
5.  Communication of determination.  Within two weeks after a landlord or its screening company completes its evaluation of an applicant, the landlord must provide applicant with a written communication of acceptance, conditional acceptance, or denial and in the case of a conditional acceptance or denial, describe the basis for the decision.
6.  Disability related modification requests.
a.  An applicant with a disability that is otherwise approved through the screening process and requests a modification may not be denied housing based solely on a landlord’s denial of a requested modification.
b.  If a landlord denies an applicant’s modification request, the landlord must provide the applicant two successive 24-hour periods within which to request alternative modifications.
c.  If no reasonable modification can be made to the dwelling unit to address the applicant’s disability, the applicant, if otherwise eligible, may accept the dwelling unit without modification.
7.  Screening fees. In addition to the requirements of ORS Chapter 90.295, the following apply:
a.  If a landlord conducts all of an applicant screening through professional screening company, the landlord must not charge applicant a screening fee greater than that charged by the screening company.
b.  If a landlord conducts some but not all of an applicant screening through the use of a professional screening company, the landlord must not charge applicant a screening fee that is more than 25 percent greater than the cost charged by the screening company.
c.  If a landlord conducts all of an applicant screening and does not use the screening services of a professional screening company, the landlord must not charge applicant a screening fee that exceeds 10 percent more than the cost for a professional screening company serving the Portland-Metro area to complete the same work.
8.  Appeals. A landlord must offer the applicant an opportunity for appeal for 30 days following the denial of an application.  The landlord’s appeal process must:
a.  Provide the applicant the opportunity to correct, refute or explain negative information that formed the basis of the landlord’s denial;
b.  Prequalify the applicant for rental opportunities at the landlord’s properties in Portland for the three months following the date a landlord approves an application reviewed on appeal; and
c.  Waive the applicant’s screening fee for the three months following the approved appeal.  Prior to waiving the screening fee, the landlord may require the applicant to self-certify that no conditions have materially changed from those described in the landlord’s approved application.
E.  Applicant evaluation; encouraging most inclusive evaluation process.  If applying a screening criteria to an applicant in addition to the general screening process, a landlord is encouraged to apply criteria consistent with, or less prohibitive than, the low-barrier criteria described in Subsection E. below.  If the landlord applies any single criterion more prohibitive than any of the low-barrier criteria listed in Subsections E.1.a. through c. below, then the landlord must apply the individual assessment process as described in Subsection F.  In applying low-barrier criteria, landlords must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.
1.  Low-barrier screening criteria.  In adopting low-barrier criteria, landlords agree not to reject applicants for:

(7)  Medical or education/vocational training debt.
c.  Rental history:
(1)  An action to recover possession pursuant to ORS 105.105 to 105.168 if the action:
(a)  Was dismissed or resulted in a general judgment for the applicant before the applicant submitted the application;
(b)  Resulted in a general judgment against the applicant that was entered three or more years before the date of the application;
(c)  Resulted in a general judgment against the applicant that was entered fewer than three years before the date of the application if:
(i)  The termination of tenancy upon which the action was based was without cause (no-cause eviction); or

1.  Consideration of supplemental evidence; individual assessment.  In evaluating an applicant using the individual assessment, a landlord must accept and consider all supplemental evidence, if any is provided with a completed application to explain, justify or negate the relevance of potentially negative information revealed by screening.

H.  Damages.  A landlord that fails to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Section will be liable to the applicant for an amount up to $250 per violation plus actual damages, reasonable attorney fees and costs (collectively, “damages”).

30.01.087 Security Deposits; Pre-paid Rent.
(Added by Ordinance 189581; amended by Ordinances 189715, 190064, 190905, and 191973, effective January 1, 2025.) 

In addition to the protections set forth in the Act and in Sections 30.01.085 and 30.01.086, the following additional tenant protections regarding security deposits apply to rental agreements for a dwelling unit covered by the Act.  A term not defined in this Chapter that is defined in the Act has the meaning set forth in the Act.
A. Amount of security deposit.
1. If a landlord requires, as a condition of tenancy, a security deposit that includes last month’s rent, a landlord may not collect as an additional part of the security deposit more than an amount equal to one-half of one month’s rent. 
2. If a landlord does not require last month’s rent, a landlord may not collect more than an amount equal to one month’s rent as a security deposit.
3. If a landlord conditionally approves an application subject to an applicant’s demonstration of financial capacity or to offset risk factors identified by the applicant screening for tenancy as described in Section 30.01.086, the landlord may require payment of an amount equal to one-half of one month’s rent as a security deposit in addition to the other amounts authorized in this Subsection.  The landlord must allow a tenant to pay any such additional security deposit in installments over a period of up to three months in installment amounts reasonably requested by the tenant.
B. Bank deposit of tenant funds.
1. Within two weeks following receipt of a tenant’s funds paid as a security deposit or for last-month’s rent, a landlord must deposit all of such funds into a secure financial institution account segregated from the landlord’s personal and business operating accounts.  If the account is an interest-bearing account, all interest will accrue proportionately to the benefit of the tenant and must be returned to the tenant with the unused security deposit in accordance with Subsection B.2. below.  If the account bears interest, the landlord is required to pay such interest in full, minus an optional five percent deduction for administrative costs from such interest, to the tenant unless it is used to cover any claims for damage. For interest bearing accounts, the landlord must provide a receipt of the account and any interest earned at the tenant’s request, no more than once per year.  The rental agreement must reflect the name and address of the financial institution at which the security deposit is deposited and whether the security deposit is held in an interest-bearing account.
2. A landlord must provide a written accounting and refund in accordance with ORS 90.300.
C. Amounts withheld for repair.
1. A landlord may only apply security deposit funds for the repair and replacement of those fixtures, appliances, equipment or personal property that are identified in the rental agreement.
2. A landlord may claim from the security deposit amounts equal only to the costs reasonably necessary to repair the premises to its condition existing at the commencement of the rental agreement (commencement date); provided however, that a landlord may not claim any portion of the security deposit for routine maintenance; for ordinary wear and tear; for replacement of fixtures, appliances, equipment, or personal property that failed or sustained damage due to causes other than the tenant’s acts or omissions; or for any cost that is reimbursed by a landlord’s property or comprehensive general liability insurance or by a warranty.
3. Any landlord-provided fixtures, appliances, equipment, or personal property, the condition of which a landlord plans to be covered by the tenant security deposit, must be itemized by description and incorporated into the rental agreement.
4. A landlord may apply the tenant security deposit to the cost of repair or replacement of flooring material only if repair or replacement is necessitated by use in excess of ordinary wear and tear and is limited to the costs of repair or replacement of the discrete impacted area and not for the other areas of the dwelling unit. A discrete impacted area is defined as the general area of the dwelling unit where the repair or replacement is needed, which may include an entire room, closet, hallway, stairway, or other defined space, but not beyond.
5. A landlord may not apply the tenant security deposit to the costs of interior painting of the leased premises, except to repair specific damage caused by the tenant in excess of ordinary wear and tear, or to repaint walls that were painted by the tenant without permission.
D. Condition reports.
1. Preparing and updating the condition report and condition report addendum.
a. Prior to the commencement date, the landlord must make reasonable efforts to schedule a time that is convenient for both the landlord and the tenant for a walk through of the unit to complete a report noting the condition of all fixtures, appliances, equipment and personal property listed in the rental agreement and noting damage (the condition report). Both the tenant and the landlord must sign the condition report. The landlord must take pictures of the items noted in the condition report and share those photographs with the tenant.
b. Should the landlord and tenant be unable to schedule a mutually convenient time to walk through the unit to complete the condition report, the landlord must complete the condition report prior the commencement date. The landlord must take pictures of the items noted in the condition report and share those photographs with the tenant on the commencement date.
c. Within seven days following the commencement date, the tenant may complete and submit to the landlord a condition report addendum on a form provided by the landlord. If the tenant does not complete and submit a condition report addendum to the landlord within seven days of the commencement date, then the landlord’s condition report becomes final. 
d. If the tenant submits a condition report addendum, the Landlord has seven days to dispute the condition report addendum in writing. If the landlord fails to timely dispute the condition report Addendum, then the condition report, as modified by the condition report addendum, must establish the baseline condition of the dwelling unit as of the commencement date against which the landlord will be required to assess any dwelling unit repair or replacement needs identified in a final inspection (defined below) that will result in costs that may be deducted from the tenant security deposit as of termination of the rental agreement (the termination date).
e. If the landlord disputes the condition report addendum, and the landlord and tenant are unable to resolve the dispute as to the condition of the dwelling unit at the commencement date, the condition report and condition report addendum must be retained by the landlord. Any unresolved dispute as to the condition of the dwelling unit as of the commencement date will be resolved, if necessary, in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
f. The landlord must update the condition report to reflect all repairs and replacements impacting the dwelling unit during the term of the rental agreement and must provide the updated condition report to the tenant, and the tenant may complete or update the condition report addendum to reflect all repairs and replacements.
2. Within one week following the termination date a landlord must conduct a walk-through of the dwelling unit at the tenant’s option, with the tenant or tenant’s representative, to document any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear not noted on the condition report (the “final inspection”).  The tenant, or the tenant’s representative, may choose to be present for the final inspection.  The landlord must give notice of the date and time of the final inspection at least 24 hours in advance to the tenant.
3. A landlord must prepare an itemization describing any repair and replacement in accordance with the fixture, appliances, equipment, or personal property identified in the rental agreement.  The landlord must document any visual damage in excess of normal wear and tear with photographs that the landlord must provide to the tenant with a written accounting in accordance with ORS 90.300 (12).  To the extent that a landlord seeks to charge labor costs greater than $200 to a tenant, the landlord must provide documentation demonstrating that the labor costs are reasonable and consistent with the typical hourly rates in the metropolitan region.  A landlord may not charge for the repair of any damage or replacement of malfunctioning or damaged appliances, fixtures, equipment, or personal property noted on the condition report.
E. Notice of rights.  Contemporaneously with the delivery of the written accounting required by ORS 90.300(12), a landlord must also deliver to the tenant a written notice of rights regarding security deposits (notice of rights).  The notice of rights must specify all tenant’s right to damages under this Section.  The requirement in this Subsection may be met by delivering a copy of this Section to the tenant and contact information for the nearest Legal Aid Services of Oregon, or online and physical address of the Oregon State Bar.
F. Rent payment history.  Within five business days of receiving a request from a tenant or delivering a notice of intent to terminate a tenancy, a landlord must provide a written accounting to the tenant of the tenant’s rent payment history that covers up to the prior two years of tenancy, as well as a fully completed rental history form available on the Portland Housing Bureau website.  The landlord must also provide the tenant with an accounting of the security deposit as soon as practicable but no later than within the timeframes prescribed by ORS 90.300.
G. Damages.  A landlord that fails to comply with any of the requirements set forth in this Section is liable to the tenant for an amount up to $250 per violation plus actual damages, reasonable attorney fees and costs (collectively, “damages”). Any tenant aggrieved by a landlord’s noncompliance with the foregoing has a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages and such other remedies as may be appropriate.

(Amended by Ordinances 186028, 187380, 188440, and 191973, effective January 1, 2025.)

A.  City subsidy projects that in the future request and receive a city subsidy from Prosper Portland, PHB, or another Bureau or agency for the purpose of creating or preserving rental housing affordable to households below 80 percent of MFI are subject to a minimum of 60-year affordability contract requirements developed by PHB consistent with the implementing charge in Subsection 30.01.090 B.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, City subsidy projects that receive a Rental Rehabilitation Conditional Grant will be subject to a minimum of 10-year affordability contract requirement in accordance with the Rental Rehabilitation Conditional Grant product guidelines.
B.  All bureaus and agencies administering affordable rental housing subsidy programs will be responsible for implementing this section.  As the primary agency charged by the City to negotiate and confer affordable housing subsidies, PHB will develop implementing strategies consistent with the 60-year affordability principles contained in this Section, the Administrative Procedures Implementing Title 30 and the approved 1998/99 Consolidated Plan, Principle III (Ordinance 172259).
30.01.095 Partial and Full Exemptions of System Development Charges for Affordable Housing Developments.
(Added by Ordinance 183448; Amended by Ordinances 186712, 186744, 187380, 187975, 189323, 190523, 191595, and 191973, effective January 1, 2025.)

A.  The purpose of this Section is to reduce the costs of developing permanent affordable housing by exempting system development charges for qualified affordable housing developments. This Section advances a Council-recognized public policy goal to provide for a diversity of housing types to meet the needs of the citizens of the City.
B.  The City may exempt qualified affordable housing developments from paying all or part of system development charges required by Code. The applicant must apply for exemptions under this Section prior to the date the City issues the permit on the new development.  Where new development consists of only part of one or more of the uses described in this Section, only that portion of the development that qualifies under this Section is eligible for an exemption. The balance of the new development that does not qualify for any exemption under this Section is subject to system development charges to the full extent authorized by Code or general ordinance. The applicant has the burden to prove entitlement to exemptions so requested.
C.  The City will calculate exemptions in the manner authorized for calculating system development charges for rented and owner-occupied residential properties. Nonresidential properties or the nonresidential portion of mixed-use developments are not eligible for exemptions provided by this Section. Exemptions are applicable to the portions of residential properties that are directly used in providing housing for its low-income residents such as on-site manager units and shared space including but not limited to restrooms, community rooms and laundry facilities.
D.  To obtain the exemption, the applicant must present to the City, at the time of application, documentation from PHB that the development qualifies for the exemption pursuant to this Chapter.  Applicant must also pay an administration fee per unit on rental and/or owner-occupied units as determined by PHB.
E.  The City will require the recording of real property covenants in the deed records for properties receiving exemptions under this Section in order to ensure compliance, or to provide remedies for failure to restrict units, or both. Deed restrictions may be used by PHB in order to restrict sale prices and rents charged for exempt units, or to provide remedies for failure to restrict units, or both.
F.  Applicants must meet the following affordable housing qualifications to be exempt from paying all or a portion of system development charges based on the type of housing provided:
1.  Rental units.
a.  For purposes of this Section, affordable for rental housing means that the rent and expenses associated with occupancy such as utilities or fees, does not exceed 30 percent of the gross household income at the level of the rent restrictions.
b.  The units receiving an exemption must be affordable to households earning 60 percent or less of MFI at time of occupancy and must be leased, rented or made available on a continuous basis to persons or households whose incomes are 60 percent or less of MFI, as adjusted by household size and as determined by HUD for the Portland Metropolitan Area, except as provided for below.  Such units must remain affordable for a period of 60 years.
c.  Effective July 1, 2014, developments of new buildings in Old Town/Chinatown are eligible for exemption subject to the following conditions:
(1)  Units must be located in the Old Town/Chinatown Action Plan Focus Area;
(2)  Financial need must be verified through project pro forma underwriting conducted by the PDC;
(3)  All units must remain affordable for a period of not less than 10 years, to persons or households whose incomes are 100 percent or less of MFI, as adjusted by household size and as determined by HUD for the Portland Metropolitan Area, and for not less than five years thereafter must continue to remain affordable to persons or households whose incomes are 120 percent or less of MFI, as so described; and
(4)  The exemption granted by this Subsection is not available to developments for which a building permit application is filed on or after July 1, 2019, or after permit applications have been filed for development of 500 qualifying units, in the aggregate, whichever occurs first.
2.  Owner-occupied units.

(Added by Ordinance 189323; amended by Ordinances 190381 and 191973, effective January 1, 2025.)

A.  The purpose of this Section is to reduce the costs of developing permanent mass shelters, outdoor shelters and short-term shelters by exempting system development charges for qualified developments. This Section advances a Council-recognized public policy goal of providing a continuum of safe and affordable housing opportunities including transitional shelters, emergency shelters, and campgrounds/rest areas to meet the needs of Portland residents.
B.  The City will exempt qualified mass shelter, outdoor shelter and short-term shelter developments from paying all or part of system development charges required by Code. The applicant must apply for exemptions under this Section prior to the date the City issues the permit on the new development.  Where new development consists of only part of one or more of the uses described in this Section, only that portion of the development that qualifies under this Section is eligible for an exemption. The balance of the new development that does not qualify for any exemption under this Section is subject to system development charges to the full extent authorized by Code or general ordinance. The applicant has the burden to prove entitlement to exemptions so requested.
C.  The City will calculate exemptions in the manner authorized for calculating system development charges. Exemptions are applicable to the portions of mass shelter, outdoor shelter and short-term shelter projects that are directly used in providing shelter and services for their residents such as on-site manager facilities and shared space including but not limited to restrooms, kitchens, community rooms, social service facilities, and laundry facilities.
D.  To obtain the exemption, the applicant must present to the City, at the time of application, documentation from Multnomah County’s Joint Office of Homeless Services, or other designated agency, that the development qualifies for the exemption pursuant to this Chapter.
E.  The applicant must provide permit drawings that clearly note the exemption, if granted, in order to ensure compliance.  Alternatively, the drawings must provide remedies for failure to comply that are acceptable to the City.  Permit drawings must state the following: “This project received SDC exemptions for mass shelters, outdoor shelter or short-term shelter. The exemptions only apply to the mass shelter, outdoor shelter or short-term shelter development and associated facilities including social services. If a future tenant improvement or change of occupancy creates a use that is not a mass shelter, outdoor shelter or short-term shelter or associated service, system development charges will be assessed for the new use. It is the permittee’s responsibility to maintain proper documentation of the continued mass shelter, outdoor shelter or short-term shelter use.”
